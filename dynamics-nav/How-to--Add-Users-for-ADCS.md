# How to Add Users for ADCS in Dynamics NAV
You can add any user as a user of an Automated Data Capture System \(ADCS\). When you do this, the user must also provide a password. Optionally, you can also provide a connection that identifies the ADCS user as a warehouse employee. The ADCS user password can be different from the Windows logon password of the user.  

### To add an ADCS user  

1.  In the **Search** box, enter **ADCS Users**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New** to add a new user.  

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the user. The name cannot contain more than 20 characters, including spaces.  

4.  In the **Password** field, enter a password. The password is masked.  

### To indicate that a warehouse employee is an ADCS user  

1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  If needed, add a new warehouse employee.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit List**.  

4.  Select a warehouse employee from the list. In the **ADCS User** field, choose the drop-down arrow, and then select the name of an ADCS user from the list.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The default warehouse for the employee should be a warehouse that is set up to use ADCS. You can do this by opening the location card for the warehouse, and then choosing the Use ADCS check box.
