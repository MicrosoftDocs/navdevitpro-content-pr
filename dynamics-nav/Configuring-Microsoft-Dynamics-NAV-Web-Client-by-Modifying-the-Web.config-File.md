# Configuring a [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] Instance for the Web Client
You can create a [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server_instance_md](includes/nav_web_server_instance_md.md)] instance for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] by using the Setup wizard to install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] or by running the [New-NAVWebServerInstance cmdlet](Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Management/new-navwebserverinstance.md). When you set up a web server instance, you are configuring the connection from the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. The connection settings, along with several other configuration settings, are saved in a configuration file for the web server instance.

## <a name="WebClientSettingsFile"></a>About the configuration file
The name of the configuration file depends on your [!INCLUDE[navnow_md.md](includes/navnow_md.md)].

-   With [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](includes/nav2018_md.md)], because the web server instances run on .NET Core, the configuration file for the web server instances is a .json file type called **navsettings.json**. The navsettings.json file is a Java Script Object Notification file type that is similar to files that use the XML file format.

- With [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] and earlier, the configuration file is a .config type file called **web.config**. 

 After installation, you can change the configuration by modifying the [!INCLUDE[web_server_settings_file_md.md](includes/web_server_settings_file_md.md)]. There are two ways to modify this file: directly or using PowerShell.

### Where to find the navsettings.json or web.config file
The navsettings.json or web.config file is stored in the physical path of the web server instance, which is by default is *%systemroot%\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[WebServerInstanceName]*. *[WebServerInstanceName]* corresponds to the name (alias) of the web server instance in IIS, for example, *c:\inetpub\\wwwroot\\[!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance_md](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)]* 

## Modify the navsettings.json or web.config file directly

1. Open the navsettings.json any text or code editor, such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.

    Each setting is a defined by a key-value pair. The navsettins.json file has the format:

    `"keyname": "keyvalue",`

    The web.config file has the format:

    <add key="keyname" value="keyvalue"/>

    `keyname` is the name of the configuration setting and `keyvalue` is the value. For example, the configuration setting that specifies the credential type for authenticating users is:

    `"ClientServicesCredentialType":  "Windows",`

    or
    
    `<add key="ClientServicesCredentialType" value="Windows"/>`


2.  Find the configuration settings that you want to change, and then change the values.

    See the [Settings](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-by-Modifying-the-Web.config-File.md#Settings) section for a description of each setting.
3.  When you are done making changes, save the file.
4.  Restart the [!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance_md](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)] for the changes to take effect.
    
    For example, in IIS Manager, in the **Connections** pane, select website node for [!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance_md](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)], and then in the **Actions** pane, choose **Restart**. Or, from your desktop, run `iisreset`. 

## Modify the navsettings.json or web.config file by using the Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration PowerShell cmdlet
The PowerShell script module **NAVWebClientManagement.psm1** includes the [Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration cmdlet](Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Management/Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration.md) that enables you to configure a web server instance.

1. Depending on your installation, run the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell_md](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] or Windows PowerShell as an administrator.

    For more information, see [Get started with the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server_instance_md](includes/nav_web_server_instance_md.md)] cmdlets](How-to--Set-Up-Multiple-Web-Server-Instances-for-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#GetStartedWebServerCmdlets).

2. For each setting that you want to change, at the command prompt, run the following command:

    ```
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -Server [MyComputer] -ServerInstance [NAVServerInstanceName] -WebServerInstance [MyNavWebServerInstance] -KeyName [Setting] -KeyValue [Value]
    ```

    Replace:
    -   `[MyComputer]` with the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_server_md](includes/nav_server_md.md)]
    -   `[NAVServerInstanceName]` with the name of the server instance, such as **[!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance_md](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)]**.
    -   `[MyNavWebServerInstance]`with the name of the web server instance for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].
    -   `[KeyName]` with the name of the setting. Refer to the next section in this article.
-      `[KeyValue]` with the new value of the setting.


## <a name="Settings"></a>Settings in the navsettings.json  
The following table describes the settings that are available in the navsettings.json.   

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If modifying the file directly, place values in double quotes `""`.    

|Setting/KeyName|Description|

|ClientServicesChunkSize|Sets the maximum size, in kilobytes, of a data chunk that is transmitted between [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. Data that is transmitted between [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is broken down into smaller units called chunks, and then reassembled when it reaches its destination.<br /><br /> Values: From 4 to 80.<br /><br /> Default value: 28|  
|ClientServicesCompressionThreshold|Sets the threshold in memory consumption at which [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] starts compressing data sets. This limits amount of consumed memory. The value is in kilobytes.<br /><br /> Default value: 64|  
|ClientServicesProtectionLevel|Specifies the security services used to protect the data stream between the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. This value must match the value that is specified in the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] configuration file.

|ClientServicesCredentialType|Specifies the authorization mechanism that is used to authenticate users who try to connect to the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Configure Authentication of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Users](How-to--Configure-Authentication-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-Users.md) and [Users and Credential Types](Users-and-Credential-Types.md).<br /><br /> The credential type must match the credential type configured for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] connects to. For information about how to set up the credential type on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).<br /><br /> Values: Windows, UserName, NavUserPassword, AccessControlService<br /><br /> Default value: Windows|  
|ClientServicesPort|Specifies the TCP port for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. This is part of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]â€™s URL.<br /><br /> Values: 1-65535<br /><br /> Default value: 7046|  
|ServicePrincipalNameRequired|If this parameter is set to **true**, then the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] can only connect to a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that has been associated with a service principal name \(SPN\).<br /><br /> If this parameter is set to **false**, then the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] attempts to connect to the configured [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] service, regardless of whether that service is associated with an SPN.<br /><br /> For more information about SPNs, see [How to: Configure Delegation for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Configure-Delegation-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md).<br /><br /> Default: **false**|  
|SessionTimeout|Specifies the maximum time that a connection between the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] can remain idle before the session is stopped.<br /><br /> In the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], this setting determines how long an open [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] page or report can remain inactive before it closes. For example, when the SessionTimeout is set to 20 minutes, if a user does not take any action on a page within 20 minutes, then the page closes and it is replaced with the following message: **The page has expired and the content cannot be displayed.**<br /><br /> The time span has the format \[dd.\]hh:mm:ss\[.ff\]:<br /><br /> -   dd is the number of days<br />-   hh is the number of hours<br />-   mm is the number of minutes<br />-   ss is the number of seconds<br />-   ff  is fractions of a second<br /><br /> Default value: 00:20:00|  
|ShowPageSearch|Specifies whether to show the **Search for Page or Report** icon in the ribbon pane of the Role Center. The **Search for Page or Report** lets users find [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects, such as pages, reports, and codeunits. **Note:**  The **Search for Page or Report** option only finds objects that are available from the Departments page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. <br /><br /> If you do not want to the **Search for Page or Report** icon available in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], then set the parameter to **false**.<br /><br /> Default value: **true**|  
|UnknownSpnHint|Specifies whether to use a server principal name when establishing the connection between the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] server and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. This setting is used to authenticate the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], and it prevents the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] server from restarting when it connects to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] for the first time. You set values that are based on the value of the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key.<br /><br /> Value: The value has the following format.<br /><br /> \(net.tcp://NavServer:Port/ServerInstance/Service\)=NoSpn&#124;SPN<br /><br /> -   NavServer is the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].<br />-   Port is the port number on which the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is running.<br />-   ServerInstance is the name of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br />-   NoSpn&#124;SPN specifies whether to use an SPN. If the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key is set to **false**, then set this value to NoSpn. If the ServicePrincipalNameRequired key is set to **true**, then set this value to Spn.<br /><br /> Default value: \(net.tcp://localhost:7046/[!INCLUDE[nav_server_instance](includes/nav_server_instance_md.md)]/Service\)=NoSpn<br /><br /> If you set this key to the incorrect value, then during startup, the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] will automatically determine a correct value. This will cause the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to restart. **Note:**  For most installations, you do not have to change this value. Unlike the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], this setting is not updated automatically. If you want to change the default value, then you must change it manually.|  
|DnsIdentity|Specifies the subject name or common name of the service certificate for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].<br /><br /> This parameter is only relevant when the ClientServicesCredentialType is set to UserName, NavUserPassword, or AccessControlService, which requires that security certificates are used on the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] to protect communication. **Note:**  You can find the subject name by opening the certificate in the Certificates snap-in for Microsoft Management Console \(MMC\) on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. <br /><br /> For more information, see [How to: Configure Authentication of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Users](How-to--Configure-Authentication-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-Users.md).<br /><br /> Value: The subject name of the certificate.<br /><br /> Default value: none|   
|SigninHelpLink|Specifies the URL to open if the user selects help on the sign in dialog.<br /><br /> Default value: none|  
|HelpServer|Specifies the name of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] must connect to, such as *MyServer*.<br /><br /> Default value: none|  
|HelpServerPort|Specifies the TCP port on the specified [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server that the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] can access Help through, such as **49000**.<br /><br /> Default value: none| 
| Feedback Link  |Specifies the URL to a feedback system for gathering end-user feedback about the application. |
|Community Link	|Specifies the URL to a community or resource for sharing information.|
|Privacy Link	|Specifies the URL to the privacy information for the application. This link also appears in the sign-in page.|
