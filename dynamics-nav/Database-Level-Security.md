# Database-Level Security
The first layer of security when you open [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] is database security.  
  
## Database-Level Security  
 After you start [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] and attempt to open the database, your credentials are checked. If you have not been granted permission to open the database then the database is not listed in the [Available Databases](uiref/-$-S_2342-Available-Databases-$-.md) window. For more information about granting a user permission to create or work with a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database, see [Setting Database Owner and Security Administration Permissions](Setting-Database-Owner-and-Security-Administration-Permissions.md).  
  
 For more information about how to open a database, see [How to: Open Databases](How-to--Open-Databases.md).
