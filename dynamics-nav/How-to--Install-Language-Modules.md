# How to: Install Language Modules

To install language modules in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you must first download the language module from [Language Modules for Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018](https://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/deployment/downloads/product-releases/msdnav2018download) \(requires PartnerSource login\), and then you install the following different components separately:  
  
- [Server Component](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md#Server)  

- [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows Client Component](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md#RoleTailored)  

- [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Component](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md#WebClient)  

- [Microsoft Office Outlook Component](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md#Outlook) \(optional\)  

- [Database Component](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md#Database)  

- [Profiles](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md#Profiles)  

  After you install a language module, you may need to translate additional strings for customized objects in the application.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  For mixed language modules to work on your computer, you must install the language pack that corresponds to your regional settings.  

 For more information, see the following topics:

##  <a name="Database"></a> Database Component  

#### To install the database component of a language module  

1.  Verify that the license that you are using allows you to compile objects.

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  If you do not compile objects before you import the language module, you will receive the “Could not load the selected type library” error when you import a language module in the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)]. The error occurs because several objects have a reference to Microsoft Office 2013 components, and these are not present when you have Microsoft Office 2010 installed.

7.  In the **Language Module Import** window, browse to the location where you downloaded the language module, navigate to the Database folder, select the .flm file, and then choose **Open**.
