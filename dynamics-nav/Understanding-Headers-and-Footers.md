# Report Header and Footer Limitations in Dynamics NAV
Headers and footers in client report definition \(RDLC\) report layouts have the following limitations:  
  
-   From the header, you cannot refer to group-specific information in the body.  
  
-   You can have only one report header, one body, and one report footer in a report.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can have group headers and footers and table headers and footers.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Report Viewer 2015 does not render hidden expressions in headers or footers.  
  
 The following topic describes modifications that require creating a new hidden text box so that the data can be used in a header or footer:
