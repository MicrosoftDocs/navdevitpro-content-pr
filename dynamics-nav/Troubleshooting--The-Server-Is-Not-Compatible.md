# Troubleshooting: The Server Is Not Compatible
If the versions of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)] are not compatible, you will get an error.  
  
 On the tablet when connecting the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)] version 1.1 to [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)], you will get the following error:  
  
 **This version of the device app is not compatible with the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] service. Please upgrade your app.**  
  
 On the phone when connecting the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)] version 2.0 to [!INCLUDE[navcrete](includes/navcrete_md.md)], you will get the following error:  
  
 **This server is not compatible and must be upgraded to a newer version. Please contact your system administrator.**  
  
 The versions are compatible as described below:  
  
-   If you have the latest version of the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)] on the tablet, you can connect to both [!INCLUDE[navcrete](includes/navcrete_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)].  
  
-   If you have the latest version of the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)] on the phone, you can only connect to [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)].  
  
-   If you have an older version of the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)], you cannot connect to [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)] until you have updated the [!INCLUDE[nav_uni_app](includes/nav_uni_app_md.md)] to the latest version from the device store.
