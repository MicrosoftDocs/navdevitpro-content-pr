# Extending the Windows Client Using Control Add-ins
In [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] control add-ins add custom functionality to Role Centers and pages. The following sections provide an overview of the documentation that is available to develop and use control add-ins.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To learn how to write control add-ins that can be used both on [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] and on [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], see [Extending Any Microsoft Dynamics NAV Client Using Control Add-ins](Extending-Any-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Client-Using-Control-Add-ins.md).
