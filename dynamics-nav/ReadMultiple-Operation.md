# ReadMultiple Operation
Reads a filtered set of records. This operation returns an array of entities. The ReadMultiple operation allows the consumer of a web service to specify the number of records to be returned at one time. This can reduce load on the server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Records on a page that were inserted after the page was retrieved are not read. Records on a page may be incorrectly included in the retrieved dataset if they were deleted after the page was retrieved.  
  
## Method Signature  
 `Entity [] ReadMultiple(Entity_Filter[] filterArray, string bookmarkKey, int setSize)`  
  
## Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|*filterArray*|Type: Entity\_Filter\[\]<br /><br /> An array of record filters.|  
|*bookmarkKey*|Type: String<br /><br /> The last record bookmark of the page that was previously read.<br /><br /> To return the first page of results, set *bookmarkKey* to NULL.|  
|*setSize*|Type: Integer<br /><br /> The size of the set to be returned.<br /><br /> To return the complete set of results, set *setSize* to zero.<br /><br /> To reverse the order of the results, set *setSize* to negative.|  
  
## Results  
  
|Result name|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|*entity\[\]*|Type: An array of Entities<br /><br /> An array of a specific object type that represents the page. Contains the latest values that are present on the page.<br /><br /> The server will return at most *setSize* records. If all records have been already returned, then subsequent calls will return no records \(a 0-element array in C\#\). You should keep calling the ReadMultiple function until no records are returned.|  
|*entity.Key*|Type: String<br /><br /> The key of the last record read. In C\#, you can access it with `Entity[Entity.Length-1].Key`. Pass this as *bookmarkKey* for the next ReadMultiple call.|  
  
## Faults  
 This operation does not throw faults when no matching records are present. Instead, it returns an empty record list.  
  
 Faults are possible if they are generated by the C/AL code.  
  
## Remarks  
  
## Retrieving Last Page  
 To retrieve the last record of a page, set *setSize* to -1. Using negative numbers in *setSize* sorts the records in descending order.  
  
## Entity\_Filter  
 You use the *Entity\_Filter* parameter with the ReadMultiple operation. It describes a filter that can be applied on a specific field in a record. The *Entity\_Filter* parameter contains two members: Field and Criteria.  
  
-   Field contains the name of the field that the filter is applied to. This name comes from the Entity\_Fields enum.  
  
-   Criteria is of type string and can contain any valid [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] style filter that is specified in a standard [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] filter format.  
  
## Usage Examples  
 The following example returns the first 100 customer names that start with an S. For a detailed code example, see [Walkthrough: Registering and Using a Page Web Service \(SOAP\)](Walkthrough--Registering-and-Using-a-Page-Web-Service--SOAP-.md).  
  
```c#  
List<Customer_Filter> filterArray = new List<Customer_Filter>();  
Customer_Filter nameFilter = new Customer_Filter();  
nameFilter.Field = Customer_Fields.Name;  
nameFilter.Criteria = "S*";  
filterArray.Add(nameFilter);  
Customer[] custList = service.ReadMultiple(filterArray.ToArray(), null, 100);  
```  
  
 This example uses the *bookmarkKey* argument to read customer records in batches of 10:  
  
```c#  
Customer_Service service = new Customer_Service();  
service.UseDefaultCredentials = true;  
  
const int fetchSize = 10;  
string bookmarkKey = null;  
List<Customer> customerList = new List<Customer>();  
  
// Reads customer data in pages of 10.  
Customer[] results = service.ReadMultiple(new Customer_Filter[] { }, bookmarkKey, fetchSize);  
while (results.Length > 0)  
{  
    bookmarkKey = results.Last().Key;  
    customerList.AddRange(results);  
    results = service.ReadMultiple(new Customer_Filter[] { }, bookmarkKey, fetchSize);  
}  
  
// Prints the collected data.  
foreach (Customer customer in customerList)  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(customer.Name);  
}  
```
