# SETCURRENTKEY, SETRANGE, SETFILTER, GETRANGEMIN, and GETRANGEMAX Functions
The following functions are used to filter records in a table:  
  
-   SETCURRENTKEY  
  
-   SETRANGE  
  
-   SETFILTER  
  
-   GETRANGEMIN  
  
-   GETRANGEMAX  
  
 These functions are some of the most commonly used C/AL functions. They set limits on the value of one or more specified fields, so that only a subset of the records are displayed, modified, deleted, and so on.  
  
## SETCURRENTKEY Function  
 SETCURRENTKEY selects a key for a record and sets the sort order that is used for the table in question.  
  
 SETCURRENTKEY has the following syntax.  
  
```  
[Ok :=] Record.SETCURRENTKEY(Field1, [Field2],...)  
```  
  
 When you use SETCURRENTKEY the following rules apply:  
  
-   Inactive fields are ignored.  
  
-   When searching for a key, the first occurrence of the specified fields is selected. This means the following:  
  
    -   If you specify only one field as a parameter when you call SETCURRENTKEY, the key that is actually selected may consist of more than one field.  
  
    -   If the field that you specify is the first component of several keys, the key that is selected may not be the key that you expect.  
  
    -   If no keys can be found that include the fields that you specify, the return value is FALSE. If you do not test the return value, a run-time error occurs. If you do test the return value, the program will continue to run even though no key was found.  
  
## SETRANGE Function  
 SETRANGE sets a simple filter on a field.  
  
 SETRANGE has the following syntax.  
  
```  
Record.SETRANGE(Field [,From-Value] [,To-Value]);  
```  
  
 In the following example, SETRANGE filters the **Customer** table by selecting only those records where the **No.** field has a value between 10000 and 90000.  
  
```  
Customer.SETRANGE("No.",'10000','90000');  
```  
  
 When you use SETRANGE the following rules apply:  
  
-   SETRANGE removes any filters that were set previously and replaces them with the *From-Value* and *To-Value* parameters that you specify.  
  
-   If you use SETRANGE without setting the *From-Value* and *To-Value* parameters, the function removes any filters that are already set.  
  
-   If you only set the *From-Value*, the *To-Value* is set to the same value as the *From-Value*.  
  
## SETFILTER Function  
 SETFILTER sets a filter in a more general way than SETRANGE.  
  
 SETFILTER has the following syntax.  
  
```  
Record.SETFILTER(Field, String [, Value], ...]);  
```  
  
 *Field* is the name of the field on which you want to set a filter. *String* is the filter expression. *String* may contain placeholders, such as %1 and %2, to indicate where to insert the *Value* parameter\(s\) in a filter expression.  
  
 The following example selects records where the value of No. is larger than 10000 and not equal to 20000.  
  
```  
Customer.SETFILTER("No.", '>10000 & <> 20000');  
```  
  
 If the variables *Value1* and *Value2* have been assigned "10000" and "20000" respectively, then you can use the following statement to create the same filter.  
  
```  
Customer.SETFILTER("No.",'>%1&<>%2',Value1, Value2);  
```  
  
## GETRANGEMIN Function  
 GETRANGEMIN retrieves the minimum value of the filter range that is currently applied to a field.  
  
 GETRANGEMIN has the following syntax.  
  
```  
Record.GETRANGEMIN(Field);  
```  
  
 A run-time error occurs if the filter that is currently applied is not a range. For example, you can set a filter as follows.  
  
```  
Customer.SETFILTER("No.",'10000|20000|30000');  
```  
  
 With this filter, the following code fails because the filter is not a range.  
  
```  
BottomValue := Customer.GETRANGEMIN("No.");  
```  
  
## GETRANGEMAX Function  
 GETRANGEMAX retrieves the maximum value of the filter range that is currently applied to a field.  
  
 GETRANGEMAX has the following syntax.  
  
```  
Value := Record.GETRANGEMAX(Field)  
```
