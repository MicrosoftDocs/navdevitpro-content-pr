# How to: Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization
An integration table mapping links the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] table to the integration table for the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entity. For each entity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] that you want to synchronize with corresponding data in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], there must be a corresponding integration table mapping. An integration table mapping includes several settings that enable you to control how records in a [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] table and a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entity are synchronized by the corresponding integration synchronization jobs.  

You can view the status of the individual synchronization jobs that have been run for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration. This includes synchronization jobs that have been run from the job queue and manual synchronization jobs that were performed on records from the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] client.  

This is helpful when troubleshooting synchronization problem because it enables you to access details about specific errors that occur.  

### To view synchronization job log  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Integration Synchronization Log**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  If one or more error occurred for a synchronization job, the number of errors appears in the **Failed** column. To view the errors for the job, choose the number.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  You can view all synchronization job errors by opening the synchronization job error log directly. For more information, see [To view the synchronization error log](How-to-View-Synchronization-Status.md#SynchErrorLog).  

### To view synchronization job log from the Table Mappings  

1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  In the **Integration Table Mappings** window, select an entry, and then on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Integration Synch. Job Log**.

-   In the **Search** box, enter **Integration Synchronization Errors** and then choose the related link.
