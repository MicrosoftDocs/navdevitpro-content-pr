# IMPORTFILE Function (Media)
Adds a media type, such as a jpeg image, from a file to a **Media** data type field of a record for displaying the media with the record in the client. The media file is imported to the application database and a reference to the media is included in the **Media** data type field.  

## Syntax  

```  

[Guid := ]Record.MediaField.IMPORTFILE(FileName, Description[, MimeType])  
```  

#### Parameters  
 *Record*  
 Type: Record  

 Specifies the record that you want to add the media to.  

 *MediaField*  
 Type: Media  

 Specifies the field that you want to add the media to. This field must be a **Media** data type.  

 *FileName*  
 Type: Text  

 Specifies the full path and name of the media file to be added.  

 *Description*  
 Type: Text  

 Specifies text that can be used in the client to describe the media.  

 *MimeType*  
 Type: Text  

[!INCLUDE[mimetype](includes/MimeType.md)]

## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: GUID  

 The unique ID that is assigned to this media object in the database. You can also get the ID by using the [MEDIAID Function \(Media\)](MEDIAID-Function--Media-.md).  

## Remarks  
 You use this function to upload a media file, which you want to associate with a record, to the database. For example, you can upload an image for an item in table **27 Item**. When a media file is imported, it is assigned a unique identifier \(GUID\) and stored in the system table **2000000183 Tenant Media** of the application database. The GUID is then included in the **Media** data type field as a reference to the media file.  

 If you import a media file into a record that already has a media object, and a modify operation is performed, the previous media object will be permanently deleted from the database. unless there are other references to the media object in the same table field. In this case the previous media object remains in the database.

## Example  
 This example uses the IMPORTFILE function to add images to records in table **27 Item** of the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)]. After the images are imported, they will be displayed with items on page **31 Item List**, when the page is opened in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and viewed in a brick layout. The example uses C/AL code to iterate over records in the **Items** table and import an image file for records from a local folder. To support the example code that follows, you have to complete these tasks:  

-   Create the item image files and save them on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.  

     Save the images as .jpg type, and give them names that correspond to item numbers \(as specified by the **No.** field\), such as, 1000.jpg, 1001.jpg, 1100.jpg, and so on. For this example, save the files in the folder *C:\\images*.  

-   In the **Item** table, add a new field that has the data type **Media**.  

     For this example, name the field **Image**. To make the media field visible in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], include the field in the table field group that is named **Brick**.  


 With these tasks in place, you can add and run the following C/AL code to import the images. For this code example, create a codeunit and add the code to the **OnRun** trigger. But, you could also add the code other places instead, such as on an action in the **Item List** page.  

 The code requires that you create the following variables:  

|Variable name|DataType|Subtype|  
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|  
|Item|Record|Item|  
|FileName|Text||  

 This code iterates over records in the **Items** table. For each record, it looks in the *C:\images* folder for a file whose name matches the **No.** field of the record. If there is a match, the file is imported; otherwise, nothing happens.  

```  
IF Item.FINDFIRST() THEN  
BEGIN  
  REPEAT  
    FileName := 'C:\images\' + FORMAT(Item."No.") + '.jpg';  
    IF FILE.EXISTS(FileName) THEN BEGIN  
      Item.Image.IMPORTFILE(fileName, 'Demo image for item ' + FORMAT(Item."No."));  
      Item.MODIFY;  
    END;  
  UNTIL Item.NEXT < 1;  
END;  

```
