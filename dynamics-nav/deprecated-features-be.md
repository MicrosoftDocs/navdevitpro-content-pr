# Deprecated Features in the Belgian Version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Belgium that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], made available from a new page or report, made available to one or more additional countries, or replaced by a new feature.

## Standard Sales and Purchase Lines Setup
You can specify in the Sales & Receivables and Purchases & Payables windows how the standard sales or purchase codes will be entered when you create different sales or purchase documents.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?| Why?|
|----|----|
| Moved | The feature to set up standard sales or purchase lines is no longer specific to Belgium, so we have made it generally available in the standard product.|
