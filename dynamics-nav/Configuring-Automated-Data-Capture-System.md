# Configuring Automated Data Capture System
The Automated Data Capture System \(ADCS\) is a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] tool that gives companies the ability to accurately capture data for inbound, outbound, and internal documents, primarily in connection with warehouse activities. ADCS enables company employees to use handheld devices and radio frequency technology to validate warehouse inventories.  
  
 When you run the setup of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], you can provide configuration information for ADCS.  
  
## Installing ADCS in Setup  
 You can install ADCS when you run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup. You must first select ADCS as a component to install. To do this, you have to customize the list of components to install to include ADCS, which is not included in any of the predefined [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md). For more information, see [How to: Choose Components to Install](../Topic/How%20to:%20Choose%20Components%20to%20Install.md).  
  
## Configuring ADCS After Installation
