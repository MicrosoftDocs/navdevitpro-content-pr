# Planning and Preparing
This section contains information and instructions to address before you start to use the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_short](includes/nav_prov_short_md.md)] to deploy [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on Microsoft Azure or other cloud services and virtual machines.  
  
## Determine the Network Topology and Configuration  
 You can deploy [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] in different network topologies. You can deploy to a single virtual machine, where all [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] components are installed. Or, you can deploy on two virtual machines, where [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] are on one machine and SQL Server and the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database components are on the other.  
  
 For more information, see [Network Topologies for Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Azure](Network-Topologies-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-Azure.md).  
  
## Prepare the provisioning environment  
 To prepare for deployment, you must prepare the Azure subscription and the computer that you will use to provision [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on Azure.  
  
 For more information, see [Preparing for Deploying Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Microsoft Azure](Preparing-for-Deploying-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-Microsoft-Azure.md).
