# Navigation Pane Designer
Creates and customizes MenuSuite objects. Navigation Pane Designer contains menus that represent departments in a company. It also contains menu items for each department. You modify the menus and menu items in Navigation Pane Designer.  

 You can modify a basic MenuSuite object, or you can create new objects from the basic MenuSuite object. You select the MenuSuite object that you to want to modify in [Object Designer](-$-S_2051-Object-Designer-$-.md) and then make your changes in Navigation Pane Designer.
