# Control Number
Selects columns that should remain in view on a page when you scroll to the right.  

 Columns can extend beyond a controlâ€™s boundaries. This may require you to scroll to the right to see all columns. In this window, you can select columns that always remain in view even when you scroll through the remaining columns. The column that you select and all columns before it remain in view on the page. You can access this window with the [FreezeColumnID Property](../FreezeColumnID-Property.md).  

 To open this window, open Page Designer, and then select a control in the designer. On the **View** menu, choose **Property**. In the **Properties** window, locate the **FreezeColumnID** property, and then in the **Value** field, choose the **Up Arrow** button.
