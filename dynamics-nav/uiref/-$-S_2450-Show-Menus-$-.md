# Show Menus
Shows a menu in \($ S\_2401 Navigation Pane Designer $\) and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. In \($ S\_2401 Navigation Pane Designer $\), you can hide a menu so that it does not appear in both \($ S\_2401 Navigation Pane Designer $\) and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. To show a menu that has been hidden, you select it from the \($ S\_2450 Show Menus $\) window and then show it in the designer. Menus that are hidden are listed in this window.  

 To open this window, open Navigation Pane Designer, right-click the department area, and then choose **Show in Designer**. For more information about how to open Navigation Pane Designer, see [\($ S\_2401 Navigation Pane Designer $\)](-$-S_2401-Navigation-Pane-Designer-$-.md).
