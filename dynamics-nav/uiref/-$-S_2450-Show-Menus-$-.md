# Show Menus
Shows a menu in Navigation Pane Designer and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. In Navigation Pane Designer, you can hide a menu so that it does not appear in both Navigation Pane Designer and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. To show a menu that has been hidden, you select it from the Show Menus window and then show it in the designer. Menus that are hidden are listed in this window.  

 To open this window, open Navigation Pane Designer, right-click the department area, and then choose **Show in Designer**. For more information about how to open Navigation Pane Designer, see [Navigation Pane Designer](-$-S_2401-Navigation-Pane-Designer-$-.md).
