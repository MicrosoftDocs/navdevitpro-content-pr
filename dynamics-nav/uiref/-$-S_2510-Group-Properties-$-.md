# Group Properties
Groups menu items in a department. A group is a folder that you use to group related menu items. You group menu items to make them easier to access in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. A group folder is displayed on the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)] as a submenu in the department. You can create a group folder inside another group folder. The group folder that is inside another group folder is a submenu.  

 To open this window, open Navigation Pane Designer, choose a department, right-click the area where you want to group the items, and then choose **Create Group**. For more information about how to open Navigation Pane Designer, see [Navigation Pane Designer](-$-S_2401-Navigation-Pane-Designer-$-.md).  

## Properties  
 The following table describes the properties that can be set in the **Group Properties** window.  

|Property|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|--------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Caption**|The caption of the group folder that you want to create.|  
|**CaptionML**|The string that is used to identify the menu in the user interface. The [CaptionML Property](../CaptionML-Property.md) is multilanguage enabled. Therefore, it can contain a list of text strings in different languages. The string that is used is selected according to the language settings on your computer.|  
|**Department Page**|Indicates whether a group folder should be displayed on the department page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. If this property is set to **true**, the group folder is displayed on the department page. Otherwise, the group folder will be displayed in the department category where the menu items are located.|
