# SQL Server Sysprep Installation Configuration File Example
The following code is an example of a configuration file that you can use for installing SQL Server 2012 with SysPrep. You can use this code when you create a custom image for installing [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on Microsoft Azure.
