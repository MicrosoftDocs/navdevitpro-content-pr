# Running Setup on the Command Line
You can run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup at a command prompt. On the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] installation media, Setup.exe is in the root directory.  
  
 After installation, the typical location for Setup.exe on the target computer is:  
  
```  
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\<Version number>\Setup  
```  
where <Version number> is 90 for [!INCLUDE[navcorfu_md](includes/navcorfu_md.md)] and 100 for [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)].
 
 You can use the following options with Setup.exe.  
  
|Setup option|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|**/config \<Setup config file>**|Specifies path and file name information for a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup configuration file to load.<br /><br /> This is the only required option.|  
|**/help**|Displays Help about Setup.exe options.|  
|**/log \<log path>**|Specifies path and file name information for a Setup log file to be created by Setup. The file must not exist before you run Setup.|
