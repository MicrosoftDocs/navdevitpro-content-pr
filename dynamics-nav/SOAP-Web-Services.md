# SOAP Web Services
SOAP web services enable full flexibility for building operation\-centric services. They provide industry\-standard interoperability and channel and host pluggability.  
  
 You can use SOAP to interact with page or codeunit web services in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](../dynamics-nav/includes/navnowlong_md.md)].
