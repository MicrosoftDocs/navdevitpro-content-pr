# Synchronizing Dynamics NAV with Outlook
Use the Microsoft Office Outlook Add-In component to synchronize data, such as to-dos, contacts, and tasks, between [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] and Outlook. The Microsoft Office Outlook Add-In uses [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] web services.  
  
## Installing Microsoft Office Outlook Add-In  
 You must install the Microsoft Office Outlook Add-In and other components before you set up Microsoft Office Outlook Integration. The following lists show which components and subcomponents you must select in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup.  
  
 These components are not all available with any of the pre-configured [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md). To install the add-in, choose **Custom**  on the **Choose an Installation Option** pane in Setup and then select components. See [How to: Choose Components to Install](How-to--Choose-Components-to-Install.md).  
  
 It is not necessary to install all listed components on a single computer. But if you install different [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] components on different computers, then you must configure the components so that they can communicate. For more information, see [Installation and Configuration Walkthroughs](Installation-and-Configuration-Walkthroughs.md). The following table lists the components that need to be installed and configured.  
  
|Required components|Required option|  
|-------------------------|---------------------|  
|Client|Not applicable|  
|Server|Microsoft Office Outlook Integration|  
|SQL Server Database Components|Demo Database|  
|Microsoft Office Outlook Add-In|Not applicable|
