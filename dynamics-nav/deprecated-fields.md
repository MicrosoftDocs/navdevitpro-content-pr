# Deprecated Fields, and Fields Marked as Obsolete
In the [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], a number of fields have been deprecated in the current release or marked to be obsolete in a later release.  

## Definitions
Deprecated fields fall into one of the following groups:
1.	Fields moved to an extension by Microsoft  

    Partner impact: Remember to install the extension when you upgrade an existing solution from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  
2.	Fields marked as Obsolete:Pending  

    Partner impact: None in the current release, this is just a heads-up that a change is coming.  
3.	Fields no longer in use in Microsoft code  

    Partner impact: Refactor your code as soon as possible.  

## Fields moved to an extension by Microsoft in [!INCLUDE[nav2018](includes/nav2018_md.md)]
A number of fields have been moved from the base application to an extension.

### Denmark
The functionality for payments and reconciliation in the Danish version (FIK) has been moved to the Payments and Reconciliations (DK) extension. For more information, see [The Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension](/dynamics365/financials/ui-extensions-payments-reconciliation-formats-dk) in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] documentation.
