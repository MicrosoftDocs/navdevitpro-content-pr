# Welcome to the API(V1.0) for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
With [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../includes/d365fin_md.md)] you can create Connect apps. Connect apps establishes a point-to-point connection between Dynamics 365 Business Central and a 3rd party solution or service and is typically created using standard REST API to interchange data. Any coding language capable of calling REST APIs can be used to develop your Connect app. For more information to get started on Connect apps, see [Developing Connect Apps for Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-connect-apps).

> [!NOTE]  
> You've reached the V1.0 of the Business Central API. If you are looking for Beta, please go [here](../../fin-graph/index.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> For information about enabling APIs for [!INCLUDE[navnow](../includes/navnow_md.md)] see [Enabling the APIs for Microsoft Dynamics NAV](enabling-apis-for-dynamics-nav.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> REST programming is not natively supported in C/SIDE. In order to run the APIs you must add the REST dependent types manually. Existing W1 objects can compile and load, but some .NET types cannot be loaded into the C/SIDE Development environment variable editor due to missing server dependencies.

> [!TIP]  
> For information about developing extensions in AL see [Development in AL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview).
