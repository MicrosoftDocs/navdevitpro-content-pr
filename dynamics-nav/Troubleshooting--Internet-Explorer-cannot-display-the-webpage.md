# Troubleshooting: Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage
When you try to access Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client you get the following message:  
  
 **Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage**  
  
 This error can be caused by several conditions. The most common causes are that the URL is incorrect or the web site for [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] is not started.  
  
## Resolution  
 To resolve this issue, try the following:  
  
1.  Verify that the URL is correct. For more information about URLs, see [Opening a Page in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client by Using a URL](Opening-a-Page-in-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-by-Using-a-URL.md).  
  
2.  Use the Internet Information Services \(IIS\) Manager to start or restart the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] website.  
  
3.  If the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] website has Windows Firewall turned on, then verify that there is an inbound rule that allows connections on the TCP/IP port that is used by the website.  
  
     For more information, see [How to: Create an Inbound Rule in Windows Firewall for the Port of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Create-an-Inbound-Rule-in-Windows-Firewall-for-the-Port-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)
