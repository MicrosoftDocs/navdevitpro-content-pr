# Deprecated Features in the Swiss Version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Switzerland that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Block Items from Sales and Purchasing
You can block an item from being entered on sales or purchase lines, and you can block it from being posted in any transaction.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| The Block Items from Sales and Purchasing feature is no longer specific to Switzerland, so we have made them generally available in the standard product. |

## Deactivate Item Cost Tracking
When inventory is not tracked for an item, the item cost does not need to be tracked, and an item ledger entry does not need to be created. For such items, you can select the **No Stokkeeping** check box to deactivate cost tracking.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Removed| Deactivate Item Cost Tracking has been removed from the Swiss version because similar functionality is available in the standard version with the **Non-Inventory** item type. |

## Blanket Order Archiving and Document Line Tracking
You can archive and delete blanket sales and purchase orders. You can view documents that are related to sales order lines and purchase order lines, including from archived order lines. Related documents that you can track include quotes, shipments, receipts, and blanket orders. This helps you to identify documents used to process orders.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| Blanket Order Archiving and Document Line Tracking features are no longer specific to Switzerland, so we have made them generally available in the standard product. |
