# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Events
Events have the source MicrosoftDynamicsNAVServer$\[ServerInstance\]. Each event has a unique ID and is assigned to a task category. The source, IDs, and task categories enable you to filter the events that display in Event Viewer. For a description of the task categories, see [Task Categories](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events.md#TaskCateg).  
  
 The following table lists the events that are generated by the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].  
  
|Event ID|Level|Task category|Channel|Message|Remarks|

##  <a name="TaskCateg"></a> Task Categories  
 Task categories logically classify events according to the operations that they perform. In Event Viewer, you can sort, include, or exclude events in the Windows Application log based on the task categories. A task category is defined by a decimal number. The following table lists the task categories that are associated with [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] events.  
  
|Task category|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|8|Service connects to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|  
|11|Service disconnects from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|  
|12|Information, warning, or error message from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|
