# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Admin and Operational Events (EventViewer) List
Events have the source MicrosoftDynamicsNAVServer$\[ServerInstance\]. Each event has a unique ID and is assigned to a task category. The source, IDs, and task categories enable you to filter the events that display in Event Viewer. For a description of the task categories, see [Task Categories](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events.md#TaskCateg).  

The following table lists the events that are generated by the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].  

|Event ID|Level|Task category|Channel|Message/Remarks|  
|--------|-----|-------------|-------|---------------| 
|112|Error|12|Operational|Message:<br />Fatal Sql error. The connection can no longer be used.<br /><br />Remarks:<br />An error occurred on the connection from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance to the SQL database and the connection could not been established.<br /><br /> This error could be caused by one of the following reasons:<br /><br /> -   The [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] has been stopped.<br />-   The SQL server connection settings are incorrect<br />-   A network failure has occurred.<br />-   A hardware failure has occurred on the server or on your computer.<br /><br /> To resolve this issue, try to restart the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] or see [Troubleshooting: A fatal error occurred. The connection to SQL server cannot be established](Troubleshooting--A-fatal-error-occurred.-The-connection-to-SQL-server-cannot-be-established.md).|

##  <a name="TaskCateg"></a> Task Categories  
Task categories logically classify events according to the operations that they perform. In Event Viewer, you can sort, include, or exclude events in the Windows Application log based on the task categories. A task category is defined by a decimal number. The following table lists the task categories that are associated with [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] events.  

|Task category|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|

|8|Service connects to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|  
|11|Service disconnects from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|  
|12|Information, warning, or error message from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|
