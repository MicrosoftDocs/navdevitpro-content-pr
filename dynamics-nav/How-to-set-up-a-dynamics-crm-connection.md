# How to: Set Up a Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection
To integrate with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you must set up a connection between [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To set up the connection, you must provide the following information as a minimum:  

-   Dynamics 365 for Sales URL  

     You must provide the URL of the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] server to connect to. The URL specifies the URI scheme, such as HTTPS or HTTP, and the fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) that identifies the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] organization and the computer where the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] server is installed.  

     For connecting to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] Online, the format is typically *scheme://organizationname.domainname*, such as **https://mycrm.crm4.dynamics.com**, where *https* is the scheme, *myorganization* is the organization and *crm4.dynamics.com* is the domain.  

-   User name and password of a dedicated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] user account for integrating with [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

     For more information about this user account and additional [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] setup requirements, see [Create a Dynamics 365 for Sales User for Connecting to Microsoft Dynamics NAV](How-to-prepare-dynamics-crm-for-integration.md#createuser).  

### To set up, test, and enable a connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  
For all authentication types other than Office 365 authentication, you set your 365 for Sales connection up in the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection Setup** window. For Office 365 authentication, you can also use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection Setup** assisted setup, which is a wizard that helps you fill in the required setup fields. The following procedure describes how to fill in the fields in the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection Setup** window manually.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Specify the Dynamics 365 for Sales URL and the user name and password of the service account of the server.
3. On the **Authentication Type Details** FastTab, fill in the fields if you want to configure a connection to a 365 for Sales instance with a specific authentication type. For more information, see [Use connection strings in XRM tooling to connect to Dynamics 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843055).

4. To test the connection settings, on the **Home** tab, in the **Progress** group, choose **Test Connection**.  

    [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] tries to establish a connection to the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] server.  

    -   If the settings are valid and a connection can be established, a message appears that states the test was successful.  

    -   Otherwise a message appears that states the system could not connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and provides details of the error that occurred.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If data encryption is not enabled in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], you will get a message that asks whether you want to enable it. To enable data encryption, choose the **Yes** button and provide the required information. Otherwise, choose the **No** button. You can enable data encryption later. <!--For more information, see [Manage Data Encryption](../Topic/Manage%20Data%20Encryption.md).-->  

5. Select the **Enable** check box to enable the connection.  

     If you do not enable the connection now, the connection settings will be saved, but users will not be able to access [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data from [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. You can return to this window and enable the connection later.  

6. If [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronization is not already set up, you will get a message that asks whether you want to use the default synchronization setup.  

     Setting up synchronization provides the capability to keep data in records that are common to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] up\-to\-date. If you want enable to default data synchronization, choose the **Yes** button; otherwise choose the **No** button.  

     We recommend that you set up synchronization now. However, you can always set up the connection to use the default synchronization settings later. For more information, see [How to: Enable Default Dynamics 365 for Sales Synchronization Setup](How-to-Enable-Default-Dynamics-CRM-Synchronization-Setup.md).  

7. The connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is now configured and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration is enabled. You can begin to work [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. There are several advanced settings which you can view and set to enhance security and enable [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] sales order processing.  

    The following table describes the settings. To change a setting, choose the value.

    <table>
