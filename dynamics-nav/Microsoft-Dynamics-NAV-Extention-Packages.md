# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Extension Packages
You deploy your [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] extensions as packages.  

 A package file can contain a number of different artifacts that are needed for the extension, such as DELTA files and full application object .TXT files. The package also contains a manifest with metadata such as name, version, publisher and, most importantly, a globally unique identifier, the extension ID. [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] uses the extension ID to uniquely identify the extension. This ID must be maintained consistently across versions of an extension in order to upgrade properly. The [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] cmdlets that you use to create the manifest generate an ID for you, but you can also specify an ID.  

## Extension Manifests  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Use the New-NAVAppManifestFile cmdlet to write your manifest to disk so that the App ID is preserved. Then, you can use the modification cmdlet, Set-NAVAppManifest, to change attributes such as the version number.  

 The following code snippet illustrates how you can generate a manifest file.  

```  
New-NAVAppManifest -Name ‘My Extension’ -Publisher ‘Proseware’ -Version ‘1.0.0.0’ | New-NAVAppManifestFile –Path ‘C:\MyExtensionManifest.xml’  
```  

 The following code example illustrates a manifest for an extension.  

```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<Package xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/navx/2015/manifest">  
<App Id="6147E5EF-197E-43CF-B4A2-168AAE537A0B"  
Name="Microsoft Dynamics NAV Customer Loyalty"  
Publisher="Microsoft Corporation"  
Description="Customer Loyalty Extension Package for Microsoft Dynamics NAV"  
Version="1.0.23.0"  
CompatibilityId="1.0.0.0" />  
<Capabilities>   
<Capability Name="schemaChanges" />  
</Capabilities>  
<Prerequisites>  
     <Objects>  
          <Object Type="CodeUnit" Id="1600"/>  
     </Objects>  
</Prerequisites>  
<Dependencies>  
<Dependency Id="9DE57280-CC68-4612-BB26-8C8F5CF34A37"  
     Name="Microsoft Dynamics NAV Service Integration"  
     Publisher="Microsoft Corporation"  
     MinVersion="1.3.1.0"  
     CompatibilityId="1.1.0.0" />  
</Dependencies>  
</Package>  
```  

 At the root of the manifest is the `Package` element. The following sections describe the other elements and settings.
