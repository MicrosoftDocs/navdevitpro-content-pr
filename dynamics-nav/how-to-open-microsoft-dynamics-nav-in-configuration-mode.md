# How to: Open [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] in Configuration Mode
To configure a profile, for example to customize the profileâ€™s user interface, you must open the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] in configuration mode.  
  
### To open the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] in configuration mode  
  
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the root folder of the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. For example:  
  
    ```  
    cd navnow_x86install\RoleTailored Client  
    ```  
  
2.  Type the following command:  
  
    ```  
    Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.exe -configure -profile:"profileid"  
    ```  
  
     Replace **profileid** with the name of the profile that you want to configure.  
  
     For example, to configure the Accounting Manager profile, use this command to open the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] in configuration mode:  
  
    ```  
    Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.exe -configure -profile:"Accounting Manager"  
    ```
