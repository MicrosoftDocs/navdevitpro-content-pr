# Making a Page or Report Available From Search in the Windows Client
The [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] includes a **Search** box that lets users find pages and reports based on the objects name. The search feature finds only pages and reports that can be accessed from the navigation pane, which includes the **Home** button, **Activity** buttons, and Departments. If you want to make a page or report available from the **Search** box, then add it to the **Home** button, an **Activity** button, or Departments.  

 For information about how to add pages and reports to the **Home** and **Activity** buttons, see [Setting Up the Home Button and Home Items](Setting-Up-the-Home-Button-and-Home-Items.md) or [Creating Activity Buttons for the Navigation Pane](Creating-Activity-Buttons-for-the-Navigation-Pane.md).  

 To include a page or report under Departments, you add the page or report to the MenuSuite of the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Modify Menu Items in a MenuSuite](How-to--Modify-Menu-Items-in-a-MenuSuite.md).
