# How to Break on Record Changes in Dynamics NAV
You can specify if the debugger breaks on record changes. If the debugger is set to break on record changes, then it breaks before creating, modifying, or deleting a record. The following table shows each record change and the C/AL functions that cause each change.  
  
|Record change|C/AL functions|  
|-------------------|---------------------|  
|Create a new record|[INSERT Function \(Record\)](INSERT-Function--Record-.md)|  
|Update an existing record|[MODIFY Function \(Record\)](MODIFY-Function--Record-.md), [MODIFYALL Function \(Record\)](MODIFYALL-Function--Record-.md), [RENAME Function \(Record\)](RENAME-Function--Record-.md)|  
|Delete an existing record|[DELETE Function \(Record\)](DELETE-Function--Record-.md), [DELETEALL Function \(Record\)](DELETEALL-Function--Record-.md)|  
  
 By default, the debugger is not set to break on record changes.  
  
 For more information about how to open the **Debugger** window, see [Activating the Debugger](Activating-the-Debugger.md).  
  
### To break on record changes  
  
1.  In the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Breakpoints** group, choose **Break Rules**.  
  
2.  In the **Debugger Break Rules** window, select the **Break On Record Changes** check box, and then choose the **OK** button.
