# Changes to Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Instance Configuration
This article lists new or removed configuration settings for [!INCLUDE[nav_server_md](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance since the previous release. These settings are available in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin_md](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] and directly in the CustomSettings.config file of a server instance.

|-------------|---------------------------------------|
|Default Language|Specifies which of the installed [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] languages on the server instance will be used as the default language in the clients. Set the value to a valid language culture name, such en-US or da-DK.<br /><br /> In the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Web and Tablet clients, the **Default Language** setting determines the language that is used if the web browser's language setting does not match any installed language or a language in the **Supported Languages** setting, if used. In the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Windows client, this is the language that is used if the language setting of the computer does not have a match.<br /><br />If there are application-specific configuration settings, this setting will be overridden by the default language setting that is specified in application-specific configuration file.

|Enable Incremental Company Deletion|Specifies whether to delete companies incrementally. If you enable this setting, when you delete a company, the company record is deleted from the database immediately but the company data that is stored in the SQL tables will be deleted later by the task scheduler.<br /><br />You can override this setting when using the [Remove-NAVCompany cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/remove-navcompany) by setting the -ForceImmediateDataDeletion parameter.<br /><br />  Default: Not enabled|  
|Supported Languages|Specifies which of the installed [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] languages on the server instance will be available for use in the clients. If you do not specify a language, then all installed languages will be available. In the client, users can switch among the supported languages.<br /><br />The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list that contains the language culture names for each language. For example, if you want client users to be able to choose among da-DK, en-US, and en-CA, set the value to da-DK;en-US;en-CA.<br /><br />If you specify any languages in this setting, then you must include the language that you specified in the Default Language setting.<br /><br />If there are application-specific configuration settings, this setting will be overridden by the supported language setting that is specified in application-specific configuration file. For more information, see [Set-NAVServerAppConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=827798).|
