# Setting Up the Home Button and Home Items

**Home** is a default activity button in the navigation pane of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] and displays items that link to List Places.  
  
## Adding Items to the Home Button

There are two ways that you can add items to the **Home** button:  

- Add actions on the Role Center page.  

     You use the Action Designer to add actions under the **HomeItems** control. You set up the actions to open list pages. Each action appears as an item under the **Home** button. For example, the following illustration shows the Action Designer for the **Home** button items that are shown in the previous illustration.  

     ![Action Designer showing the HomeItems actions](media/NAVRTCHomeItemsActionDesigner.PNG "NAVRTCHomeItemsActionDesigner")  

     For information about how to add an action under the **HomeItems** control, see [How to: Add Actions to a Page](How-to--Add-Actions-to-a-Page.md).  

- Add Cues on the Role Center page.  

     Items from Cues are added to the **Home** button automatically. When you add a cue, you set the [DrillDownPageID Property](DrillDownPageID-Property.md) to a list page for displaying the data. If there is a relevant parent entity to place the Cue item under, that link is automatically added in the navigation pane. For example, if you have a Cue named **Sales Return Orders – Open**, this item will be added under the parent item **Sales Return Orders** in the navigation pane. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Cue Based on a FlowField](Walkthrough--Creating-a-Cue-Based-on-a-FlowField.md).  

### Child Items

An item is automatically positioned as a child to another item according to the following conditions:  

- The child item targets a list page that displays filtered data from a table.  

- The parent item targets the same list page as the child item, except that list page data is not filtered.  

- The parent item is defined by an action, not a Cue.  

## Hiding and Customizing the Home Button and Items in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]

The **Home** button is always present in the navigation pane and cannot be removed or modified that included its icon. From the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], end-users and administrators can use customization to change the items under the **Home** button including:  
  
- Removing home items.  
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > Home items that are created from Cues cannot be removed using customization. The only way to remove these items is to remove the Cue by using Page Designer.  
  
- Moving home items to other Activity buttons.  
  
- Restoring the default Home items as defined in the Action Designer on the Role Center page.  
  
  As an end-user, the changes are only implemented on the user’s Role Center. For more information, see [Profiles and Role Centers](Profiles-and-Role-Centers.md).  
  
  If you are an administrator, then you can open the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] in the Configuration mode and the changes that you make will be implemented on the Role Center for all users. For more information, see [How to: Open Microsoft Dynamics NAV in Configuration Mode](how-to-open-microsoft-dynamics-nav-in-configuration-mode.md).
