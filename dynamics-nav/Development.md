# Development
Before you begin developing code for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you should consider the following:  

-   How to start learning about C/AL.  

-   How to build on your C/AL knowledge.  

-   How to build an application by using your knowledge of C/AL.  

-   What the differences are between developing applications that run on different clients.  

-   What the differences are between developing in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] and earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

-   How to upload and download files between the server and the client.
