# Designing Word Report Layouts
A Word report layout is a based on Word document \(.docx file type\) that acts as a template for viewing and printing reports from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients. Word report layouts enable you to design report layouts by using Word 2013. Word report layouts are built on custom XML parts in Word. A custom XML part is structured XML that represents the dataset of a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] report. The custom XML part is used to map the data into a report at run time.  
  
 From the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], you can create and modify built\-in Word report layouts on reports. The layouts that you create on reports in the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)] become part of the report objects in the database.  
  
 From the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] users you can manage the Word report layouts that are used on reports. This includes adding a built\-in Word report layout, creating custom Word report layouts on a report, and changing which report layout is currently active on a report. For more information about how to manage Word report layouts from the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients, see [Managing Report Layouts From the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Clients](Managing%20Report%20Layouts%20From%20the%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20NAV%20Clients.md) in the Application Help for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)].
