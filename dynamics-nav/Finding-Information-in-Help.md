# Finding Information in Help

 In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], when you press the F1 key, you get Help that pertains to where you have positioned the pointer. For example, if the pointer is in Report Dataset Designer, then you will get information about that specific designer.

 When you access Help from the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], Help opens in a browser that shows the content from the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server. The [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server is a website with a high-level navigation in the left pane, and a Search box to help you find exactly what you are looking for.  

 The main pane shows the contents of the Help topic.  

 At the top of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server website, you can choose links that access the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help on Microsoft Developer Network \(MSDN\) and other useful locations.  

 For more information, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Help Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Help-Server.md).
