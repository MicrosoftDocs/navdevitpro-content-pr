# Resources for Help and Support for [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]

As a [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] partner, you have access to resources that can help you support your [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] customers, and you have access to resources that can help you be more productive as a partner.  

This page outlines the resources available to you.  

## Product Help

The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] is described on the Docs.microsoft.com site as described in the following table.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Name  |Location  |Description|
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Business functionality docs|[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav-app/](/dynamics-nav-app/) |Use this library to learn about business functionality. |
> |Development and administration docs|[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav/](/dynamics-nav/)|Use this content to learn how to extend, customize, and administrate [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].|

### Customize and extend the user assistance

Users have access to tooltips that can help them get unblocked, and context-sensitive links to learn more according to the [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] user assistance model. If you customize or extend [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], you are expected to also customize the user assistance so that users will have access to content that can help them get started, get unblocked, and learn more. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](user-assistance.md) for [!INCLUDE [d365_bus_central_md](developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)].  

### Product versions and Help versions

In general, the [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] content on the Docs.microsoft.com site reflects the latest version of [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] online with limited support for earlier versions.  

If you support [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] customers, your solution might be older than the latest version. This means that the content in the [business functionality docs](/dynamics-nav-app/) might describe functionality that your users do not have access to. For a better experience, you can deploy a website based on Help Server and, optionally, add content from the [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [d365_bus_central_md](developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] GitHub repos in addition to any content that you have otherwise contributed. For more information, see [Working with Dynamics NAV Help Server](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Help-Server.md).
