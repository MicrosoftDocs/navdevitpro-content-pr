# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows PowerShell Cmdlets
[!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] includes [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] cmdlets for administration and for development and file management of application object files and extension packages. The cmdlets are available in two Windows PowerShell modules: [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)].  

-   The [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] includes cmdlets for administering the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] deployment, such as adding and configuring [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] server instances, databases, and users. Also included are cmdlets for administering extension packages. The [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] is installed with the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].  

-   The [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] includes cmdlets for merging and modifying application object files. Also included are cmdlets for creating extension packages. The [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] is installed with the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)].  

 The cmdlets are implemented in [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] 3.0, which is included with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 and later. For other versions of Windows supported for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you can install it as part of the [Windows Management Framework 3.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=293806) on the Microsoft Download Center.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Alternatively to running [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] from where they are installed, you can import the relevant module into the [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] Integrated Scripting Environment \(ISE\).  

## <a name="StartAdminShell"></a>Starting a [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] Session  
 You must run the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] as an Administrator. On the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], choose **Start**, in the **Search** box, type **[!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)]**, right-click the related link, and then choose **Run as Administrator**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To run the cmdlets in the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)], you must be a member of the local Administrator group on the computer where the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] is installed.  

## Starting a [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)] Session  
 On the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], choose **Start**, in the **Search** box, type **[!INCLUDE[nav_dev_shell](includes/nav_dev_shell_md.md)]**, and then choose the related link.  

## <a name="GetHelp"></a>Getting Help on [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Cmdlets  
 To see the cmdlets that are available for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], type the following at the [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] prompt.  

```  
Get-Command *NAV*  
```  

 To get Help about syntax and options for a specific cmdlet, type the following cmdlet.  

```  
Get-Help <cmd name>  
```  

 For example, to get Help about the **Get-NAVServerInstance** cmdlet, type the following.  

```  
Get-Help Get-NAVServerInstance  
```  

 To get online Help in the MSDN Library for a specific cmdlet, type the following cmdlet.  

```  
Get-Help <cmd name> -online  
```  

>[!NOTE]
>The cmdlet help for [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] is currently not available in the MSDN Library. The *-online* switch parameter will open the [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)] version of the help in the MSDN Library instead. For the latest cndlet help, use the cmdlet help in command-line interface (by omitting *-online* switch parameter).
