# Action Icon Library
The [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] includes images that you can use on actions that display in the ribbon and command bar menus. To add an image to an action, you must provide the name of the image. For more information, see [How to: Set an Icon on an Action](How-to--Set-an-Icon-on-an-Action.md).  
  
## Action Images  
 By default, an imageâ€™s size is 16 pixels high by 16 pixels wide. For promoted actions, the image size is 32 pixels high and 32 pixels wide.  
  
 To view all the available action images, see [Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 Icon Collection](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394623)
