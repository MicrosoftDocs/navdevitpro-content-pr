# Deploying the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Server Components in a Two Computer Environment
In this scenario, you install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] on a computer separate than [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and the SQL Server database components.  

 ![NAV Web client installation on two computers](media/NAV_Web_Client_Install_Two_Computers.png "NAV\_Web\_Client\_Install\_Two\_Computers")  

This article also applies to deploying the [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)].

> [!TIP]  
>  For a step-by-step example that describes how to deploy this scenario, see [Walkthrough: Installing the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Server Components on Two Computers](Walkthrough--Installing-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Server-Components-on-Two-Computers.md).  

## Pre-Installation Tasks  
 The following table includes tasks to perform before you install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].  

|Task|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|For more information, see|  
|----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Make sure that system requirements are met.|Verify that the computer has the required hardware and software installed.|[System Requirements for Microsoft Dynamics NAV](System-Requirements-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV.md)|  
|Install Internet Information Services.|When you install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup creates a website for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] on IIS. If IIS is already installed, then make sure that the required features are enabled.<br /><br/>**Note:**  Instead of installing and configuring IIS manually, you can use [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup to install IIS and enable the required features.|[How to: Install and Configure Internet Information Services for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Install-and-Configure-Internet-Information-Services-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)|  
|Determine the TCP port for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and allow communication on the port through Windows Firewall.|[!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup creates a website on IIS for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. During Setup, you will have to choose the port to use for the site. The default port that is used in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup is port 8080. If you are not sure of which port to use, then use the default port.<br /><br /> If the computer is running Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 with Windows Firewall enabled, then you have to create an inbound rule that allows communication on the port.|[How to: Create an Inbound Rule in Windows Firewall for the Port of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Create-an-Inbound-Rule-in-Windows-Firewall-for-the-Port-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)|  
|Set up the service account for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and the SQL Server database.|Optional. When you install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can specify a user account that will be used to log on to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance and [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database. The default service account is Network Service. If you want to use Network Service, then no action is required for this task.|[Provisioning the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Account](Provisioning-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Account.md).|  
|Obtain and install an SSL certificate.|Optional. If you want to configure SSL on the connection to [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], then complete the following procedures:<br /><br /> -   Obtain an SSL certificate.<br />-   Import the certificate into the local computer store of the computer on which you will install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].<br />-   Obtain the certificate's thumbprint.<br /><br />**Note:**  You can also configure SSL after you have installed the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [Post-installation Tasks](Deploying-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Server-Components-in-a-Two-Computer-Environment.md#PostInstall).|[How to: Configure SSL to Secure the Connection to Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Configure-SSL-to-Secure-the-Connection-to-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)|  

## Installation Tasks  
 The following table includes tasks for installing the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].  

|Task|Description|For more information, see|  
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|  
|Install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database components.|On the computer designated for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database, run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup. During Setup, choose the **Choose an installation option**,  and then choose the **Server** and the **SQL Server Database Components** options.|[How to: Run Setup](How-to--Run-Setup.md)|  
|Install the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].|On the web server computer, run [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup and choose the **Web Server Components** option.|[How to: Install the Web Server Components](How-to--Install-the-Web-Server-Components.md)|  
|Configure delegation from the web server to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)].|Because [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is running on a different computer than the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)], you must configure the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] to delegate its access to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] on behalf of the device trying to access the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].|[How to: Configure Delegation for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Configure-Delegation-for-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)|  

##  <a name="PostInstall"></a> Post-installation Tasks  
 The following table includes tasks to configure the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] after installation. These tasks are optional depending on your organizational and network requirements.  

|Task|Description|For more information, see|  
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|  
|Change the user authentication method.|The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] supports the same authentication methods as the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], which include Windows, UserName, NavUserPassword, and AccessControlService. By default, the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] uses Windows authentication.|[How to: Configure Authentication of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Users](How-to--Configure-Authentication-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-Users.md)|  
|Secure the connection to the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] with SSL.|You can help secure [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] data that is transmitted over the Internet by enabling Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) on the connection to the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].|[How to: Configure SSL to Secure the Connection to Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client](How-to--Configure-SSL-to-Secure-the-Connection-to-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)|  
|Change the user authentication method.|The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] supports the same authentication methods as the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], which include Windows, UserName, NavUserPassword, and AccessControlService. By default, the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] uses Windows authentication.|[How to: Configure Authentication of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client Users](How-to--Configure-Authentication-of-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-Users.md)|  
|Set up multiple [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] applications on a website.|You can set up multiple web server instances for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] on the existing website. The web server instances will use the same address \(URL\) except with an alias that specifies the specific application.|[Creating and Managing [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server_instance_md](includes/nav_web_server_instance_md.md)] Instances Using PowerShell](How-to--Set-Up-Multiple-Web-Server-Instances-for-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md)|  
|Configure web browsers on devices.|The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] supports several different web browsers.
