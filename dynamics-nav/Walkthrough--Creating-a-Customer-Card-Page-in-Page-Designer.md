# Walkthrough: Creating a Customer Card Page in Page Designer
In this walkthrough, you learn how to create a card page to display customer details. A card page is used to display more detailed information than is available on a list page. You can link a list page to a card page so that when you select a customer in the list, you open a specific customer card page.  
  
## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough provides an overview of how to create a card page in Page Designer, how to add controls, and how to preview the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  
  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  
  
-   Creating a card page.  
  
-   Adding controls.  
  
-   Saving the page.  
  
-   Promoting customer data to the FastTab header.  
  
-   Running the page.  
  
### Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] installed with a developer license.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)].  
  
## Story  
 Simon is a partner working for CRONUS International Ltd. Kevin, the Sales Manager, has asked Simon to create a card page to store customer information. He wants to be able to view the details of each customer in a card page when he chooses a customer in the customer list.  
  
## Creating a Card Page  
 To create a customer card page to run on the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], Simon knows that he must use the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] Object Designer.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In this walkthrough, to learn about the properties and controls of a card page you will create a card page from a blank page. Object Designer also includes a wizard that you can use to create a card page that sets up many properties and controls for you. For more information about the wizard, see [How to: Create a Page](How-to--Create-a-Page.md).  
  
#### To create a card page  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, choose **Page**, and then choose **New**. The **New Page** window opens.  
  
3.  In the **Table** text box, choose the up arrow, select the **Customer** table, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
4.  Choose **Create blank page**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
     The new page opens in Page Designer.  
  
5.  On the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
6.  In the **PageType** property, and set the **Value** column to **Card**.  
  
7.  Close the **Properties** window.  
  
8.  In Page Designer, in the first row, and in the **Name** column, enter **CustomerCardContainer**, and accept the default values for **Type** and **Subtype** fields.  
  
 You have now successfully created a card page. However, you cannot save your card page until you have added at least one control to your page.  
  
## Adding a Control to Display Customer Details  
 Simon wants to add a basic control to his card page to display a selection of fields from the customer table in a group that can be expanded or collapsed. He knows that all card pages use the FastTab control to display data in this way, so he decides to add a FastTab control to his blank card page.  
  
#### To add a control to display customer details  
  
1.  In the second row, in the **Name** column, enter **CustomerCardGroup**, and in the **Caption** column, enter **General**. Set **Type** to **Group** and set **SubType** to **Group**.  
  
2.  In the third row, set **Type** to **Field**. On the **View** menu, choose **Field Menu**.  
  
3.  In the **Field Menu** window, select fields from the **Customer** table.  
  
     Select multiple fields by holding down the Ctrl key while you select the following rows:  
  
    -   No.  
  
    -   Name  
  
    -   Search Name  
  
    -   Name 2  
  
    -   Address  
  
    -   Address 2  
  
    -   City  
  
    -   Contact  
  
    -   Phone No.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button. A message box appears with the following message: "Do you want to add the fields that are selected in the field menu?" Choose **Yes**.  
  
     If the **OK** and **Cancel** buttons are unavailable, see [Page Designer Troubleshooting](Page-Designer-Troubleshooting.md) for more information.  
  
     In Page Designer, your card page should now look something like the following illustration.  
  
     ![Customer Card page in Page Designer](media/NAV_CardPageElements.png "NAV\_CardPageElements")  
  
5.  Select the next available blank row on your page, below **Phone No.**, and on the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
6.  In the **Properties** window, in the **Caption** property, enter **Kevin's Customer Card**.  
  
7.  In the **CaptionML** property, accept the default value and close the **Properties** window.  
  
## Saving the Page  
 Simon thinks it would be a good idea to save the page before making any further changes.  
  
#### To save the page  
  
1.  When you close Page Designer, the **Save As** dialog box is displayed.  
  
2.  In the **ID** field, enter **50002**, and in the **Name** field, enter **Kevin's Customer Card**. For the ID, you can choose any number in the 50000 range.  
  
3.  Leave the **Compiled** check box selected and choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can clear the **Compiled** check box to save your page, but your page will not run. You can compile only if there are no errors on the page.  
  
## Promoting Customer Data to the FastTab Header  
 Now Simon wants to highlight key customer information on his customer card page. He can do this by making the contents of some fields visible on the FastTab header, even when a FastTab is in its collapsed state.  
  
#### To promote key customer data to the FastTab header  
  
1.  Open Object Designer if it is not already open.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, select page 50002, **Kevin's Customer Card**, which you created earlier, and choose **Design** to open the card page.  
  
3.  In Page Designer, under **CustomerCardGroup**, select a field in one of the FastTab groups. For example, in the **General** group, you can select **Contact**. This field will be displayed on the **General** FastTab.  
  
4.  With this row selected, on the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
5.  In the **Importance** property, set the **Value** field to **Promoted**.  
  
6.  Close the **Properties** window and close Page Designer. The **Save Changes** dialog box is displayed.  
  
7.  Choose **Yes** to save and compile **Kevin's Customer Card** page.  
  
 You have now successfully promoted **Contact** to the FastTab header.  
  
## Running the Page  
 Test your new card page by running the RoleTailored client.  
  
#### To run the page  
  
1.  In Object Designer, select page 50002, **Kevin's Customer Card**, and then choose **Run**.  
  
     The [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] opens and displays the new card page with all the fields you selected.  
  
2.  Collapse the **General** FastTab on your card page and notice that the contact field you selected is displayed.  
  
## Next Steps  
 Simon wants to create a customer list page for his customers and to create a link from the list page to Kevin's Customer Card page.
