# Working with Microsoft Dynamics NAV Setup
> [!NOTE]  
>  Before installing [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], you must uninstall any prior version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  
  
## Key Concepts for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup  
 Before you install [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], you should understand the following concepts about Setup.  
  
### Installation Options  
 [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup offers installation options that are designed for a typical use or type of user. For more information, see [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md).  
  
### Setup Configuration Files  
 In addition to using Setup to actually install software, you can use it to capture a set of Setup decisions to a Setup configuration file which you can then save and distribute. When you load a Setup configuration file with [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup, previously saved options and configurations are applied.  
  
### Required Security Configuration  
 After you install [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], you must then set up security. For more information, see [Security Overview](Security-Overview.md).
