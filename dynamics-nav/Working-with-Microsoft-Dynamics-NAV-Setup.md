# Working with Microsoft Dynamics NAV Setup
> [!NOTE]

## Key Concepts for [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup  
 Before you install [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], you should understand the following concepts about Setup.  

### Installation Options  
 [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup offers installation options that are designed for a typical use or type of user. For more information, see [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md).  

### Setup Configuration Files
