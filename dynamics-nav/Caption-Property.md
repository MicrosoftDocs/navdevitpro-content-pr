# Caption Property
Sets the text string that displays with the object, control, or other element in user interface for the current language.  

## Applies To  

-   Codeunit objects  

-   XMLport objects  

-   Pages, including general page properties, Container, Group, Part, and Field controls.  

-   Query objects and query columns  

-   Reports  

-   Tables and table fields  

-   XMLport objects  

## Remarks  
 A caption is the text used to show the identity of a control \(for example, in the caption bar of a page or a label for another control\).  

 The Caption property value is taken from the value of the [CaptionML Property](CaptionML-Property.md) for the current user language if the CaptionML Property is set. If you enter a value for the Caption Property, then the value is included in CaptionML property for the current language. For example, if the current system language is Danish, then a value of **DAN =\<value>** is placed in the CaptionML field.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For query columns, when you run the query from Object Designer, the About This Query window that opens in the [!INCLUDE[rtc](includes/rtc_md.md)] displays the value for the [Name Property](Name-Property.md) of the query column, not the Caption property or CaptionML Property.
