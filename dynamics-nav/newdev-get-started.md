# Getting Started
To get started writing extensions in code for the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] you will need a [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] tenant, and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a cross platform editor that you will use for coding and debugging. For the preview, you will download a VM from the Microsoft Azure Gallery which is set up for trying out the new development environment.

## Steps
1) Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
2) Sign up for your virtual developer machine for [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] in the [Microsoft Azure Gallery](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template).
