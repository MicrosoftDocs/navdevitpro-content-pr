# Getting Started
To get started writing extensions for [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] you will need a [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] tenant, and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a cross platform editor that you will use for coding and debugging. For the preview, you will download a VM (virtual machine) from the Microsoft Azure Gallery. The VM is set up for trying out the new development environment.

## Steps
1) First, you will need an Azure subscription. You can sign up for a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).   
2) Go to [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryFeaturedMenuItemBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home) and search for **Microsoft Dynamics NAV Developer Preview**.  
3) Follow the instructions to deploy and run.   
4) When you have a virtual machine set up, you will see a Welcome text and here you can choose to try out the developer preview following the instructions on the screen.

# Getting started with Visual Studio Code
With the developer preview, you get sample code that compiles and runs. When you want to start creating your own project, you will need to create a new project to contain it. Visual Studio Code manages projects by including all files from a directory. Whatever files exist in that directory are then part of your project. In addition there are two other configuration files; ```app.json``` and ```launch.json```. You can define these yourself, possibly by copying the files from sample code or you can have the system autogenerate them for you. Building the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B) will create the ```app.json``` file and publishing (F5) will generate the ```launch.json``` file.
Within these files, youâ€™ll need to set up some parameters to connect to your server. The following table shows these settings.

Settings in the ```app.json``` file:

|Setting|Mandatory|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|
|id|Yes|The unique ID of the extension. When app.json file is automatically created, the ID is set to a new GUID value.|
|name|Yes|The unique extension name.|
|publisher|Yes|The name of your publisher, for example: **NAV Partner**, **LLC** |
|application|Yes, if base application objects are extended or referenced |The minimum supported version and locale of the base application to extend, for example: ```{  "version": "10.0.0.0",  "locale": "W1"  }```|
|platform|Yes, if system tables are referenced in the extension|The minimum supported version of the platform symbol package file, for example: "10.0.0.0". See the **List of objects in the platform symbol file section** below for the list of object symbols contained in the platform symbol package file.|
|packageCachePath|Yes, if base application is extended or system tables are referenced| The path to the folder where referenced symbol package files are located. The path could either be absolute or relative to the current extension working directory, for example: "../../resources"|

Settings in the ```launch.json``` file:

|Setting|Mandatory|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|
|server|Yes, if connecting to an on-premises server|The HTTP URL of your server, for example: http://localhost|
|serverInstance|Yes, if connecting to an on-premises server|The instance name of your server, for example: NAV|
|port|No|The port on which the development endpoint is running on the server, default value: 7049|
|tenant|No|The tenant ID in case the server is configured for multitenancy.|
|windowsAuthentication|No|Specifies whether Windows or Azure authentication should be used for publishing the extension. Currently only Windows authentication is supported.|
|startupObjectId|No|The ID of the startup object to launch when you press F5. Currently only objects of type Page are supported.|
