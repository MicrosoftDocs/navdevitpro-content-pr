# How to: Prepare Dynamics 365 for Sales for Integration
This topic describes how to set up and configure [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] for integrating with [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)]. You must complete the following tasks:  

1.  Create a user for connecting to and synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

     For more information, see [Create a Dynamics 365 for Sales User for Connecting to Microsoft Dynamics NAV](how-to-prepare-Dynamics-CRM-for-Integration.md#createuser).  

2.  Install the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] integration solution for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     This task is optional. You only need to complete this task if you want the functionality that is provided by the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] integration solution. For more information, see [Install the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Integration Solution](how-to-prepare-Dynamics-CRM-for-Integration.md#InstallNavSolution).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To perform the tasks in this topic, you must have the System Administrator security role or equivalent privileges in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

##  <a name="createuser"></a> Create a Dynamics 365 for Sales User for Connecting to Microsoft Dynamics NAV  
 As a minimum, this must be a non\-interactive user account that has the required privileges to write, read, modify, and delete data in the entities that will be integrated with [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

 You will use this user account to set up the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not use this account to sign in to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] to modify entities records that are integrated with [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] because the changes will be ignored by integration synchronization jobs in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].

#### To create the connection user  

-   For more information about how to create users in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616518](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616518).  

##  <a name="InstallNavSolution"></a> Install the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Integration Solution  
 [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] includes a solution that enables users to access coupled records in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], such as customers and items, from records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts and products. The solution adds a link on the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] record pages that opens the coupled [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] record. The solution is also used to display information from [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] in a part on certain entity records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts. Installing this solution is optional.  

#### To install the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] solution  

1. From [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] installation media \(DVD\), copy the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip file to your computer.  

    The DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip file is located in the **CrmCustomization** folder. This file is the solution package.  

2. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], import the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip as a solution  

    This step adds the **Dynamics NAV Connection** entity and **Dynamics NAV Account Statistics** entity in the system and additional items such as navnow integration security roles.  

    For more information about how to manage solutions in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519).  

3. (Optional) Set up the **Dynamics NAV Connection** entity to display in the **Settings** area of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

    This enables [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] users who are assigned the **Dynamics NAV Admin** role to modify the entity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information about how to modify entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616521](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616521).  

4. Assign the **Dynamics NAV Integration Administrator** role to the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] connection user.  

5. Assign the **Dynamics NAV Integration User** role to all users who require the use of the features provided by the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] integration solution.  

   If you install the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] integration solution after you have set up the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] from in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], you must modify the connection setup to point to the URL of the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Set Up a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection](How-to-Set-Up-a-Dynamics-CRM-Connection.md)
