# Designing Reports
You design a report by first defining the dataset and then designing the visual layout. You design the dataset for reports in Report Dataset Designer of the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)]. When designing the layouts, there are two different types: RDLC report layouts and Word report layouts. You design RDLC report layouts in Visual Studio Report Designer. You design Word report layouts in Word. After you design a report's dataset and layout, you can make it available for running and printing in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client applications.  

 The following table describes where to find information about how to design reports.
