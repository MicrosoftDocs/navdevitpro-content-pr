# Feature Limitations of the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web Client

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](includes/nav2018_md.md)]. [See [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] version](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client-2017.md).

[!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] supports most of the same [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects and features as [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], but there are some small differences. This topic lists the features that are not supported or are partially supported by [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. These features are listed compared with the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. The topic is divided into the following sections:  

-   [General Features](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#General)  

-   [Objects](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#Objects)  

-   [Pages Features](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#Page)  

-   [Report Features](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#Report)  

-   [C/AL Functions](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#Functions)  

-   [User Interface Features](Feature-Limitations-of-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Web-Client.md#User)  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this topic, *partially supported* means that the feature does not have all the capabilities as it does in [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or it works differently than in [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  

##  <a name="General"></a> General Features  
 The following table lists general features that are not fully supported by [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  

|Feature|Level of support|Remarks|  
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|  
|COM and Automation|Not supported.|If a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] object implements Automation \(objects and servers\), then an error occurs when the object is run in [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].|  
|Departments and MenuSuite|Not supported.|The **Departments** button does not appear in the navigation pane of Role Center in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. Instead Page Search is available from an action in the navigation pane of the Role Center and on the top right corner of a page. MenuSuite is used to build the Departments page in [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].|  
|System Indicator|Not supported.|The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] always shows the name of the company that it connects to.|  
|Microsoft .NET Framework Interoperability|Partially supported.|Microsoft .NET Framework interoperability objects that are configured to run on the client are not supported; objects that run on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] are supported. For more information, see [How to: Set .NET Framework Types to Run on the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows Client or Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Computers](How-to--Set-.NET-Framework-Types-to-Run-on-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-Client-or-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Computers.md).|  
|Configuring the user interface for a profile|Partially supported.|You cannot perform configuration using the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. Instead, you use the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. For more information, see [Configuring the User Interface (UI) for Users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav-app/admin-configure-user-interface).|  

##  <a name="Objects"></a> Objects  
 The following object types are not supported by [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  

|Feature|Level of support|Remarks|  
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|  
|XMLport|Partially supported.|Request pages are not supported. If you try to run an XMLport with a request page from the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], then you receive an error that the XMLport page type is not supported.<br /><br /> To run an XMLport without using a request page, you can set the [UseRequestPage Property](UseRequestPage-Property.md) of the XMLport in XML Designer to **No**. Or, if the XMLport is run from C/AL code by calling the [RUN Function \(XMLport\)](RUN-Function--XMLport-.md), then you can set the *ReqWindow* parameter to **false**.|

Client-side printing is not supported in this scenario. For more information, see the following topics.<br /><br /> -   [How to: Specify Printer Selection for Reports](How-to--Specify-Printer-Selection-for-Reports.md)<br />-   [STARTSESSION Function \(Sessions\)](STARTSESSION-Function--Sessions-.md)<br />-   [Printing Reports from a Background Session](Printing-Reports-from-a-Background-Session.md)<br />|
