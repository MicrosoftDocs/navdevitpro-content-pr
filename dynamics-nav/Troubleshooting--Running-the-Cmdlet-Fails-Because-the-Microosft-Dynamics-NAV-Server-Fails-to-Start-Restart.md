# Troubleshooting: Running the Cmdlet Fails Because the Microosft Dynamics NAV Server Fails to Start-Restart
You can find more information about the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] failure reason in the event log. The error most likely occurs because of the impossibility of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] to correctly configure the ACL for the ports that are used by the serverâ€™s communication endpoints. In some situations, when there are URLACL entries for the same ports but reserved by other services, including other [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]s, the removal procedure fails because of insufficient permissions. The user account running the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] has to have administrative permissions for the modification of the URLACL to succeed. To fix the issue, you can try one of the following:  
  
-   Remove the URL ACL entries manually. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Configuring Web Services to Use SSL \(SOAP and OData\)](Walkthrough--Configuring-Web-Services-to-Use-SSL--SOAP-and-OData-.md).  
  
-   Set the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] to run as Administrator account on your computer.
