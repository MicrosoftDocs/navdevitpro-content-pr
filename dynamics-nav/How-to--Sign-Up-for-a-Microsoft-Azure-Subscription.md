# How to: Sign Up for a Microsoft Azure Subscription
To gain access to the Microsoft Azure management portal, you must have an Azure subscription and a Microsoft account associated with that subscription. You use the Azure management portal when you configure [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] for use of Azure Active Directory \(Azure AD\) as authentication mechanism, or if you deploy [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on Azure.  

 You will create one or more subscriptions for the Azure account. A subscription is a grouping of Azure services and applications, including the virtual machines. The subscription provides a way to control the access to and the use of the Azure subscribed service. In a situation where you will have multiple [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] deployments, you may decide to use a separate subscription for each deployment in order to track expenses related to each deployment. All of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] components for a single deployment must be deployed to the same subscription however. You can set up different administrators for each subscription as required. For more information, see [Overview of Subscription Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=317945).  

### To sign up for an Azure subscription  

1. On the [Microsoft Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=285197) page, log in with a Microsoft account.  

    For more information about Microsoft accounts, see the [What is a Microsoft account?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271494) page.  

2. Choose **Free Trial** and follow the instructions to create a new account. Alternatively, choose **Purchase Options** and then choose the agreement that suits your purpose.  

   When your account is set up successfully, the **Subscriptions** page of the Account Center appears.  

### To create a subscription  

1. If you are not already signed on to the **Subscriptions** page of the Account Center, then visit the [Azure Account Management Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=317944) page and choose **Account Center**.  

2. Choose **add a subscription**.  

3. On the **Add a Subscription** page, choose a subscription offer from the available list to create the subscription.  

   You can now use the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) to manage Azure accounts, subscriptions, hosted services, virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and more.
