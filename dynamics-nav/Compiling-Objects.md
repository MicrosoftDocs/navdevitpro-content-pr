# Compiling Objects
Before you can run a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] object, you must compile the object. To compile an object, do one of the following:  

-   In Object Designer, choose **Tools**, and then choose **Compile**. Any syntax errors are displayed in a dialog box. Any errors or warnings about obsolete constructs in a three-tier environment are displayed in the **Error List** window.  

-   Run finsql.exe with the CompileObjects command. Any errors or warnings are added to the log file. For more information, see [CompileObjects](CompileObjects.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To compile an object, you must have a developer license.  

## Syntax Errors  
 Syntax errors are detected by the C/AL compiler when you try to compile C/AL code, either in a codeunit or as code in another object, such as a table, page, report, query, or XMLport. If you open an object in the designer and then compile the object, then if the compiler detects a syntax error, when you press ENTER and acknowledge the error message, the C/AL editor opens with the cursor in front of the expression that has the error. If you compile an object directly from Object Designer and if the compiler detects a syntax error, then the C/AL editor does not open to show where the error occurred.  

 The compiler will not compile code that contains a syntax error.  

## Obsolete Construct Errors  
 The following types of obsolete construct errors and warnings are displayed:  

-   Unsupported data type warnings for Binary and XMLport types.  

-   Unsupported function calls.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Unsupported function calls for reports are not reported in the **Error List** window.  

 If you select an error in the **Error List** window and choose **Design**, then the C/AL Editor opens for the object to which the error or warning relates.  

## Multilanguage Captions  
 When you compile application objects, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] stores the objects in Unicode encoding. If the application objects contain multilanguage captions, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] uses the code page that is relevant for the languages that you have specified. For more information, see [Developing Multilanguage-Enabled Applications](Developing-Multilanguage-Enabled-Applications.md).
