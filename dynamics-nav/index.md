# Welcome to the Developer and IT-Pro Help for Microsoft Dynamics NAV
[!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] is a complete enterprise resource planning (ERP) software solution for mid-sized organizations that is fast to implement, easy to configure, and simple to use. Right from the start, simplicity has guided—and continues to guide—innovations in product design, development, implementation, and usability. In this section, you can find information about deployment and administration, and you can find information about developing for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].
> [!NOTE]  
> You also use [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] to develop for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't know why you ended up here? Were you trying to find the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] developer center on MSDN, perhaps? Or were you trying to find another location that has been deprecated? We apologize for the confusion, but across Microsoft we are deprecating some sites and moving content around. That means that the developer center is no longer available, and neither is the icon library that we published there. Due to redirection, you don't always end up where you expect, but this page will be the landing page for developer and IT-pro content for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] going forward.  

## Feedback

At this point in time, both links point at [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] for technical reasons. But if you submit feedback about the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] docs in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] GitHub repo, we will triage it and apply relevant changes here in the docs for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

Previously submitted feedback has not been deleted but is no longer visible online. Please read the [Docs.microsoft.com blog](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs) for more information.
