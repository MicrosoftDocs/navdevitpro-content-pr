# SETRANGE Function (Query)
Sets a filter on a range of values on a column of a query dataset.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Query.SETRANGE(Column[, FromValue][, ToValue])  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Query*  
 Type: Query  
  
 A variable of the Query data type that specifies the query that you want to filter.  
  
 *Column*  
 Type: Text  
  
 The name of the column in the query that you want to filter. The name is defined by the column's [Name Property](Name-Property.md) in Query Designer.  
  
 *FromValue*  
 Type: Any  
  
 The lower limit of the range. The data type of this parameter must match the data type of *Column*.  
  
 If you set only the *FromValue* parameter, then the *ToValue* parameter is set to the same value as *FromValue*.  
  
 *ToValue*  
 Type: Any  
  
 The upper limit of the range. The data type of this parameter must match the data type of *Column*. If you omit the *ToValue* parameter, then the only the value that is specified for *FromValue* is used, which enables you to filter on a single column value instead of a range.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you omit both the *FromValue* and *ToValue* parameters, then the function removes all filters that are already set on the column.  
  
## Remarks  
 SETRANGE is a quick way to set a simple filter on a field. The SETRANGE function is functionally equivalent to calling *Query*.SetFilter\(ColumnName, ‘FromValue..ToValue’\).  
  
 To apply filters to a dataset, the **SETRANGE** function must be called before the **OPEN**, **SAVEASXML**, and **SAVEASCSV** functions, as shown in the following example. To remove filters, you call the [CLEAR Function](CLEAR-Function.md) or **SETRANGE** without values for the *FromValue* and *ToValue* parameters.  
  
```  
Query.SETRANGE(Column1, FromValue, ToValue);  
Query.OPEN;  
Query.READ;  
CLEAR(Query);  
```  
  
 A call to the **SETRANGE** function automatically closes a query dataset that is currently open. Therefore, the following code is unauthorized and will fail because there is no open dataset for the **READ** function to read.  
  
```  
Query.OPEN;  
Query.READ;  
Query.SETRANGE(Column1, FromValue, ToValue);  
Query.READ;  
```  
  
 In addition to the **SETRANGE** function, you can apply filters to a query using the **SETFILTER** function and the [DataItemTableFilter Property](DataItemTableFilter-Property.md) and [ColumnFilter Property](ColumnFilter-Property.md) in Query Designer.  
  
|If the **SETRANGE** function...|then...|  
|-------------------------------------|-------------|  
|Sets a filter on the same field as the **DataItemTableFilter** property|The two filters are joined into a resulting filter.|  
|Sets a filter on the same field as the **ColumnFilter** property|The **SETRANGE** function overwrites the **ColumnFilter** property, so the filter that is set by the **SETRANGE** function that is applied to the dataset.|  
|Sets a filter on the same field as the **SETFILTER** function|The function that is called last is applied to the dataset.|  
|Sets a filter on a field that has global filters that are applied by the **FILTERGROUP\(1\)** function|The filters of the **SETRANGE** function are added to the global filters.|  
  
 For example, a query has the following filters set on the **Quantity** column in Query Designer:  
  
-   **DataItemTableFilter** property: Quantity=FILTER\(\<>10\)  
  
-   **ColumnFilter** property: Quantity=FILTER\(\<>5\)  
  
 `Query.setRange(Quantity, 1, 15)` will result in a filter that is equivalent to: 1 \< Quantity \<15, except for 10.  
  
 For more information about how to set filters in Query Designer, see [Understanding Query Filters](Understanding-Query-Filters.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following C/AL code example demonstrates how to use the **SETRANGE** function on a query. The example code sets a filter on a query column and saves the resulting dataset as a CSV file. A message also displays when the query is run that indicates the filter on the column.  
  
 This example requires that you do the following:  
  
1.  Create a query called **Customer\_SalesQuantity** that has the following characteristics:  
  
    -   Links table **18 Customer** with table **37 Sales Lines** from the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)].  
  
    -   Includes columns for the **Name** and **No.** fields from the Customer table and the **Quantity** field from Sales Lines table.  
  
         For step-by-step instructions for creating this query, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Query to Link Two Tables](Walkthrough--Creating-a-Query-to-Link-Two-Tables.md).  
  
2.  Create the following C/AL variables and text constant in the object that will run the query, such as a codeunit.  
  
    |Variable name|DataType|Subtype|  
    |-------------------|--------------|-------------|  
    |MyQuery|Query|Customer\_SalesQuantity|  
  
    |Text constant name|ENU Value|  
    |------------------------|---------------|  
    |Text000|Customer name = %1, Quantity = %2|  
  
 The following C/AL code uses the **SETRANGE** function to filter a query dataset over a range of values on the **Quantity** column. You can add the code to a codeunit, and then run the codeunit to see the results.  
  
```  
// Sets a filter to display only sales quantities greater than 10.  
MyQuery.SETRANGE(Quantity, '10', '50');  
// Sets a filter to display the columns with the value Selangorian Ltd. only.  
MyQuery.SETFILTER(NAME, 'Selangorian Ltd.');  
// Runs the query.  
MyQuery.OPEN;  
// Reads each row in the dataset and displays message with column values.  
// Stops reading when there are no more rows remaining in the dataset (READ is FALSE).  
WHILE MyQuery.READ DO  
BEGIN  
  MESSAGE(Text000, MyQuery.Name, MyQuery.Quantity);  
END;   
// Saves the resulting dataset as a CSV file.  
MyQuery.SAVEASCSV('c:\temp\CustomerSales.csv');  
MyQuery.CLOSE;  
```  
  
 When the code is run, a message that resembles the following appears for each row in the dataset:  
  
 **Customer name = Selangorian Ltd., Quantity = 30**
