# PageType Property
Sets the type of page that is created.  

## Applies To  
 Pages  

## Remarks  
You typically set this property when you are create new pages, but you can change it at any time. The value for the **PageType** property specifies the Page layout in [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [Touring the RoleTailored Client Pages](Touring-the-RoleTailored-Client-Pages.md).  

The exception is the value *API*. Pages of this type are used to generate web service endpoints and cannot be shown in the user interface.
