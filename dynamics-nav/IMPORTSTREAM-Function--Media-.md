# IMPORTSTREAM Function (Media)
Adds a media type \(MIME\), such as jpeg image, from an InStream object to a **Media** data type field of a record for displaying the media in the client. The media file is imported to the application database and a reference to the media is included in the **Media** data type field.  

## Syntax  

```  
[GUID] := ]Record.Media.IMPORTSTREAM(InStream ,Description[, MimeType])  
```  

#### Parameters  
 *Record*  
 Type: Record  

 Specifies the record that you want to add the media to.  

 *InStream*  
 Type: InStream  

 Specifies the InStream object that contains the media that you want to use on the record.  

 *Description*  
 Type: Text  

 Specifies text that can be used in the client to describe the media file.  

 *MimeType*  
 Type: Text  

 Specifies the media content type. The *MimeType* value must be a two-part string that consists of a type and subtype, such as *image/jpeg*, *image/gif*, or *video/mpeg*. For more information, see [Supported Media Types](Working-With-Media-on-Records.md#SupportedMediaTypes).  

 If this parameter is not specified, the IMPORTFILESTREAM function will deduct the MIME type from the file extension. For example the MIME type for a .jpg file is image/jpeg.  

## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: GUID  

 Specifies the unique ID that is assigned to this media file instance in the database table field. This ID can be retrieved by using the [MEDIAID Function \(Media\)](MEDIAID-Function--Media-.md).  

## Remarks  
 You can use this function to upload a media file that is associated with a record to the database. For example, you can upload an image of all items in table **27 Item**. When a media is imported, the object is stored in the system table **2000000184 Tenant Media** of the application database.  

 If you import a media object into a record that already has a media object, and the modify operation is performed, the previous media object will be permanently deleted, unless there are other references to the media object in the same table field.  

## Example  
 This example uses the IMPORTSTREAM function to add images to records in table **27 Item** of the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)]. After the images are imported, they will be displayed with items on page **31 Item List** when the page is opened in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and viewed in a brick layout. The example uses C/AL code to iterate over records in the **Items** table and import an image file for records from a local folder. To support the example code that follows, you also have to complete these tasks:  

-   Create the item image files and save them on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.  

     Save the images as .jpg type, and give them names that correspond to item numbers \(as specified by the **No.** field\), such as 1000.jpg, 1001.jpg, 1100.jpg, and so on. For this example, save the files in the folder *C:\\images*.  

-   In the **Item** table, add a new field that has the data type **Media**.  

     For this example, name the field **itemPicture**. To make the media field visible in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], include the field in the table field group that is named **Brick**.  

-   In the **Item List** page, add a column for the **Media** field.  

 With these tasks in place, you can add and run the following C/AL code to import the images. For this code example, create a codeunit and add the code to the OnRun trigger. But, you could also add the code other places instead, such as on an action in the **Item List** page.  

 The code requires that you create the following variables:  

|Variable name|DataType|Subtype|  
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|  
|item|Record|Item|  
|inStreamObject|InStream||  
|ImportFile|File||  

 This code iterates over records in the **Items** table. For each record, it looks in the *C:\\images* folder for a file whose name matches the **No.** field of the record. If there is a match the file, an InStream object is created for the file, and then imported into the record.  

```  
IF Item.FINDFIRST() THEN  
BEGIN  
  REPEAT  
    FileName := 'C:\images\' + FORMAT(Item."No.") + '.jpg';  

    IF FILE.EXISTS(fileName) THEN BEGIN  
        ImportFile.OPEN(fileName);  
        ImportFile.CREATEINSTREAM(InStream);  
        Item.ItemPicture.IMPORTSTREAM(InStream, 'Demo image for item ' + FORMAT(item."No."));  
      Item.MODIFY;  
      ImportFile.CLOSE;  

    END;  
  UNTIL Item.NEXT < 1;  
END;  

```
