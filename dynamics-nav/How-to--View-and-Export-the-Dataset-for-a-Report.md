# How to: View and Export the Dataset for a Report
You use the About This Report feature to view the dataset on which the report is based. Before viewing the dataset for the first time, you must activate the About This Report feature. To deactivate the feature, restart the client.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The About This Report feature remains active during the client session. When the About This Report feature is active, the size of the data that is sent to the client when you run a report is about twice the size of the data when the feature is not active.  
  
### To activate the About This Report feature  
  
1.  In the client, open the report for which you want to view the dataset.  
  
2.  To activate the feature, do one of the following steps:  
  
    -   In the request page for the report, on the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](media/ApplicationMenuIcon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon"), choose **Help**, and then choose **About This Page**.  
  
    -   In the request page for the report, choose **Preview**. On the **Print Preview** page, on the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](media/ApplicationMenuIcon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon"), choose **Help**, and then choose **About This Report**. If the About This Report feature was not previously active, then the **About This Report** window will display the following message:  
  
         “The About This Report feature is now active. Run your report again to view the dataset.”  
  
### To view the dataset from the preview page  
  
1.  Activate the About This Report feature.  
  
2.  In the client, open the report for which you want to view the dataset.  
  
3.  In the request page for the report, set any filters on the report data, and then choose **Preview**.  
  
4.  On the **Print Preview** page, on the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](media/ApplicationMenuIcon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon"), choose **Help**, and then choose **About This Report**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The data in the **About This Report** page will be filtered based the filters that you set in the request page.
