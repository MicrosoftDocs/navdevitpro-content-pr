# Deploying Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Two Virtual Machines Using Example-2VM Script
This topic describes the Example-2VM.ps1 script of the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_long](includes/nav_prov_long_md.md)]. The script is located in the \\WindowsPowerShellScripts\\Cloud\\HowTo folder on the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] installation media \(DVD\). The Example-2VM.ps1 script deploys [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on two Microsoft Azure virtual machines. After the script is run, you will have a fully functional environment that enables you to access [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] data from the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
 For information about how to use the script, see [How to: Deploy Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Microsoft Azure by Using the Example Scripts](How-to--Deploy-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-Microsoft-Azure-by-Using-the-Example-Scripts.md) or [Walkthrough: Deploying Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Two Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines](Walkthrough--Deploying-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-Two-Microsoft-Azure-Virtual-Machines.md) for a step-by-step example.  
  
## Deployment Overview  
 The Example-2VM.ps1 script creates two virtual machines, which are created based on an Azure image that you specify, and then installs [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] on one machine and [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database components for SQL Server on the other machine.

 The script restores a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] application database of your choice, along with a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] license. You can choose to install the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)] and license. The script also configures endpoints in Azure for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client service and management services and opens the communication ports in Windows Firewall.  
  
 When the script is finished, you will have a functional [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] environment that has the following characteristics:  
  
-   Two virtual machines on Azure in a virtual network and affinity group that you specify.  
  
-   A website on Internet Information Services \(IIS\) with a web application for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. The website runs on TCP port 443 and uses https protocol. Users can access [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] data by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] from a web browser.  
  
-   OData and SOAP Web services are enabled and configured to use https protocol.  
  
-   A [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] application database that is configured to have a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] license file, company, and a single [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user that has SUPER permissions.  
  
-   NavUserPassword credential type is configured as the user authentication method.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] available by using ClickOnce.  
  
## Deployment Process  
 The Example-2VM.ps1 script is a combination of several of the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_short](includes/nav_prov_short_md.md)] scripts that are called at various points in the deployment process. Before running each script, a secure Windows PowerShell remote session using HTTPS is established between the provisioning computer and the Azure virtual machine.

### Deployment Phases  
 The following flow chart illustrates the process that is executed by the Example-2VM.ps1 script to deploy [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The dashed boxes illustrate the manual alternatives in the flow.

 The following table provides a description of each phase and the Windows PowerShell script that is executed.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The scripts are located in the *Cloud\\NAVRemoteAdministrationSamples* folder of the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_long](includes/nav_prov_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Install the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Provisioning Tools for Microsoft Azure](How-to--Install-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Provisioning-Tools-for-Microsoft-Azure.md).

|**Install NAV on VM**|HowTo-InstallNAVonVM|NAVAdministration module cmdlets are executed through a PowerShell session.<br /><br /> Installs [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on the virtual machine.
