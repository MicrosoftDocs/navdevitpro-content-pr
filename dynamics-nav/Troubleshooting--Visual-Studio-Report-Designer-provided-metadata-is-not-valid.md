# Troubleshooting: Visual Studio Report Designer provided metadata is not valid
You cannot open Visual Studio Report Designer and get the following error:  
  
 **The provided metadata is not valid.**  
  
 This error can occur when the following conditions are true:  
  
-   You are using Windows 7 or Windows Vista and User Access Control \(UAC\) is turned on.  
  
-   The executable file that runs the Visual Studio development environment \(devenv.exe\) is set to run as an administrator.  
  
-   The executable file that runs the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] \(finsql.exe\) is not set to run as an administrator.  
  
 To resolve this issue, set both finsql.exe and devenv.exe to run as an administrator.  
  
### To set a program to run as an administrator  
  
1.  Right-click the .exe file, and then select **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, on the **Compatibility** tab, in the **Privilege Level** section, select **Run this program as an administrator**.
