# Update salesInvoiceLines
Update the properties of a sales invoice line object for Dynamics 365 for Financials.

## HTTP request

```
PATCH /financials/companies({id})/salesInvoices({id})/salesInvoiceLines(documentId=({id}),sequence=({number}))
```

## Request headers
|Header|Value|
|------|-----|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type  |application/json|
|If-Match      |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the **salesInvoiceLines**, the **salesInvoiceLines** will not be updated. |

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.
