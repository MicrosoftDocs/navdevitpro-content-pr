## Relationships
A customer payment is a subpage of a customer payments journal. It cannot be accessed directly.

A customer payment can be a "Parent Entity" of the dimension lines.

A Customer (customerId) must exist in the Customers table.

An Invoice (appliesToInvoiceId) must exist in the Sales Invoices Table.
