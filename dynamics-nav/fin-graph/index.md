# Welcome to the API Reference for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
Soon, you will be able to use Microsoft Graph to connect and integrate your web service or SaaS solution with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. Creating your integration through the Microsoft Graph provides simple access to all supported Microsoft products in a single endpoint, giving you a simplified experience for creating a single app with integrations across multiple Microsoft products. 

As an alternative, app developers can also integrate the service or solution directly with the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../includes/d365fin_md.md)] API endpoint, as outlined in this documentation.
