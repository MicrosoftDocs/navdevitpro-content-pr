# How to: Save a New Table
When you design the fields and keys for a new table, you need to save the table in the database before you can use it. After you have saved a table, it appears in the list of tables shown in Object Designer.  
  
### To save a table  
  
1.  With the focus on Table Designer, on the **File** menu, choose **Save**.  
  
     The **Save As** dialog box opens.  
  
2.  In the **ID** field, enter a number that will serve as a unique table identification.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  There are restrictions about which numbers you can use. Contact your Microsoft Certified Partner for information.  
  
3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the table.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  We recommend that you do not use a number at the start of the name or if you do, then do not include a blank space after the number and before any text; otherwise you might experience errors when referencing the table from C/AL code.  
  
4.  Clear the **Compiled** check box if you do not want the table to be compiled when it is saved.
