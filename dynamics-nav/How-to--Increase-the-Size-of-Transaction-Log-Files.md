# How to: Increase the Size of Transaction Log Files
You can expand your transaction log by increasing the size of one or more of its constituent files.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You must always make a backup of the database before you expand it. For more information, see [Create a Full Database Backup \(SQL Server\)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=296465).  
  
### To increase the size of a transaction log file  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], on the **File** menu, choose **Database**, and then choose **Alter**. The **Alter Database** window opens.  
  
2.  Choose the **Transaction Log Files** tab.  
  
3.  Select the transaction log file that you want to expand.  
  
4.  In the **Size \(MB\)** field, enter the new size.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Unrestricted Growth** option is not selected and the transaction log has grown to its maximum size, then you can either select the **Unrestricted Growth** option or increase the maximum size of one of the transaction log files.  
  
5.  \(optional\) To increase the maximum size of a data file, in the **Maximum Size \(MB\)** field, enter the new maximum size.
