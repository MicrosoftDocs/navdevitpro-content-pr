# Printing Reports
You can specify page settings and page orientation for a printed report from the following UI locations:  
  
-   The **Report Properties** dialog box on the client report definition \(RDLC\) report layout in Visual Studio.  
  
-   The **Properties** dialog box for the printer.  
  
-   The **Print** dialog box that is displayed immediately before you print.  
  
-   The **Page Setup** dialog box from the **Print Preview** page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  
  
 The page settings that are used for the printed report depend on the mode in which you print the report.  
  
 You can use the following modes to print a report:  
  
-   Run a report that has the [UseRequestPage Property](UseRequestPage-Property.md) set to **No**, and therefore, does not display a request page.  
  
-   Print a report from the request page without previewing the report.  
  
-   Print a report from the **Print Preview** page.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The printer that you use determines what to do if the actual paper size in the printer differs from the page size that is specified.  
  
 With [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], from the print preview, you can only print to a local printer. To print from the print preview, you must the install a client-side component. For more information, see [Printing Reports from ReportViewer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225474).
