# How to: Mount or Dismount a Tenant on a Microsoft Dynamics Server Instance
If a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is configured for multitenancy, then you can mount and dismount tenant databases by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] or **Mount-NAVTenant** or **Dismount-NAVTenant** cmdlets in [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)].  

 Mounting a tenant by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] requires that you have a running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. This is not required when you use the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)]. With the **Mount-NAVTenant**, you can mount a tenant by either specifying the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance, if it is running, or the application database.  

 This topic describes how to use the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] to mount or dismount a tenant. For more information about how to use the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)], see [Mount-NAVTenant](https://go.microsoft.com/FwLink/?LinkId=401372) and [Dismount-NAVTenant](https://go.microsoft.com/FwLink/?LinkId=401354).  

### To mount or dismount a tenant  

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].  

   1.  Choose **Start**, and in the **Search programs and files** box, type **Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Verify that the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] that you want to mount the tenant on is running, and if not, then start it:  

   1.  In the left pane of [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)], choose a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] computer. Unless you are administering a remote computer, this is **Microsoft Dynamics NAV \(local\)**.  

   2.  In the center pane, if the **Status** of the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is **Stopped**, then right-click it, and then choose **Start**.  

3. In the left pane, expand item for the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance on which you want to mount the tenant, and then choose the **Tenants** item.  

4. To mount a tenant, in the **Actions** pane, choose **Mount Tenant**, fill in the parameters on the **Mount Tenant** dialog box, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The following table describes the parameters on the **Mount Tenant** dialog box.

If the tenant database has not been mounted on a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance before, then you can specify any ID that you want that is not being used. This ID is then assigned to the database. The ID cannot be used by another tenant database and must comply with the following rules:<br /><br /> -   Contains only letters \(Aa-Zz\), numbers \(0-9\), or dashes \(-\). **Note:**      The ID is not case sensitive.<br />-   Does not start or end with a dash \(-\).<br />-   Less than 63 characters. **Important:**  If the database is the first tenant database ever to be mounted on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance, then you must set the value to **default** or select the **Overwrite Tenant ID in the Database** check box, and then specify an ID according to the previous rules. <br /><br /> If the tenant database has been mounted in a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance before, then you must specify the tenant ID that is assigned to that database or specify another ID and select the **Overwrite Tenant ID in the Database** check box.                                                                                                                                                               |   Yes    |

Select this check box if you want to use the tenant ID that is specified in the ID parameter instead of the tenant ID in the database that you are mounting to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. If you clear this check box, and the tenant database has previously been mounted with a different tenant ID, an error will occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |    No    |
   |        Synchronization Mode        | Specifies how the database schema for the tenant database is synchronized with the database schema that the mounted application database defines. The default value is **Synchronize**. You can select one of the following values.<br /><br /> -   **Synchronize without confirmation** - The database schema in the tenant database is updated with the application database schema even if data is lost. For example, if a table or a field has been deleted in the current application, the table or field is removed from the tenant database even if it contains data.<br />-   **Do not allow changes** - If the database schema in the tenant database differs from the current application, the tenant cannot be mounted against the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br />-   **Synchronize** - The database schema in the tenant database will be updated unless data is lost. For example, if a table or a field has been deleted in the current application, and it contains data in the tenant database, the tenant cannot be mounted against the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br />-   **Check only** - [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] tests if a change in the current application will cause data loss in the tenant database if the tenant is mounted with **Synchronization Mode** set to **ForceSync**. For example, if a table or a field has been deleted in the current application and it contains data in the tenant database. |    No    |


5. To save the changes, choose the **OK** button.  

    If you specified the **DatabaseUserName** and **ProtectedDatabasePassword** settings for SQL Server authentication, on the **Enable Encryption on SQL Server Connections** dialog box, choose the **OK** button.  

    Encryption keys are to secure the login credentials over the connection between the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance and the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database in SQL Server.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to save the changes.  

### To dismount a tenant  

-   In the center pane, right-click the tenant, and then choose **Dismount Tenant**.
