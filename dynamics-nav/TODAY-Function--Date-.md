# TODAY Function (Date)

Gets the current date that is used by the client.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Date := TODAY  
```  
  
## Property Value/Return Value
  
 Type: Date  
  
 The current date.  
  
## Remarks  

The date that is returned is different for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For the Windows client, TODAY returns the current day of the computer that is running the client, as determined by the date and time settings of the operating system. For the Web client, the day is determined by the Regional Setting that is set in the client. The very first time you sign-in using the Web client, the system automatically determines the Regional Setting based on your browser/computer.  

You can only use the **TODAY** function to retrieve the current date from the operating system. You cannot use it to set the date in the operating system.  
  
## Example
  
 This example shows how to use the **TODAY** function. This example requires that you create the following text constant in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Name|ConstValue|  
|----------|----------------|  
|Text000|The current date is: %1|  
  
```  
MESSAGE(Text000, TODAY);  
```  
  
 The message window could display the following:  
  
 **The current date is: 05/27/08**
