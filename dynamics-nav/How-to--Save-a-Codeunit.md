# How to: Save a Codeunit
To save a codeunit, use the following procedure.  
  
### To save a codeunit  
  
1.  Select the C/AL Editor, on the **File** menu, choose **Save As**.  
  
2.  In the **Save As** window, in the **ID** field, enter an ID number that is used as a unique identification. In the **Name** field, enter a name that is used as a label.  
  
3.  In the **Save As** window, choose **OK**.  
  
4.  In the dialog box, select whether you want to compile the code before it is saved. If you save the codeunit without compiling it, you will not be able to run it or call any of the functions it contains.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you are working on a large and complicated codeunit, you may want to save your work at regular intervals, even though it is not yet finished and cannot yet be compiled. In this case, you must clear the **Compiled** check box before you save the codeunit.
