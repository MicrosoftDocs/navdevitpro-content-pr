# Creating a Table in Dynamics NAV
When you first create a table, it does not contain any data. Nevertheless, when you create the table you must also decide what types of information you want to store in it. The information is held in fields, and each field can be declared as one of the data types that are available.  
  
### To create a table  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
     Object Designer opens.  
  
2.  Choose **Table** and then choose **New**.  
  
     Table Designer opens.  
  
 In the Table Designer, for each field you add to the table, you enter the field number, name, data type, and optionally, a length and a description.
