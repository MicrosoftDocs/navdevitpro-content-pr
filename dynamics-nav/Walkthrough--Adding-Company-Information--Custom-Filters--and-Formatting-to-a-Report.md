# Walkthrough: Adding Company Information, Custom Filters, and Formatting to a Report
When you create a report, you can add features such as formatting, custom filters, company logo, and company name to the report. Adding these features make the report readable and improves the visual presentation of the report. You will add these features to the report that you created in [Walkthrough: Designing a Report from Multiple Tables](Walkthrough--Designing-a-Report-from-Multiple-Tables.md).  

## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough shows you how to add custom filters, add company information, and format a report.  

 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Declaring the required variables.  

-   Adding a custom filter to the request page. The filter will enable users to display or hide customer details.  

-   Adding company information to the report.  

-   Hiding or showing customer details.  

-   Formatting the data.  

-   Formatting the layout of the report.  

-   Building and running the report.  

### Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

-   To create a report by using [Walkthrough: Designing a Report from Multiple Tables](Walkthrough--Designing-a-Report-from-Multiple-Tables.md). If you have not created this report, you must create it before you start this walkthrough.  

-   [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] installed with a developer license.  

-   The [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)] installed.

18. Run the report again. This time, on the Request Page, do not select the **Show Customer Details** option. Note that only the customer ID and the customer name are displayed on the report.  

## Formatting the Data  
 By default, the **DateTime** fields in the report display the date in the 1/20/2013 12:00 am format, **Boolean** fields are displayed as true or false, and the amounts fields are displayed without commas. Viktor will format the **DateTime** values so that they are displayed in the 01/20/2012 \(mm/dd/yyyy\) format,  Boolean values are displayed as **Yes** or **No**, and all the amounts are displayed in the \#,\#\#\#.\#\# format. For example, 2,222.00.  Later, the cells that display the amount values will be formatted to hide zero decimal values.  

#### To format dates value  

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], select Report Dataset Designer, choose **View**, and then choose **Layout**.  

2.  In the Visual Studio RDCL layout designer, select the posting date cell from the Cust Ledger Entry item, in the **Properties** window, locate the **Format** property, and then set the value to **d**.  

3.  Repeat step 2 to format all the dates in the report, save the changes, and then build the report.  

#### To format a Boolean value  

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], in Report Dataset Designer, select a DataItem, and then choose **Yes** in the dialog box that appears.  

2.  In the last empty row at the bottom of the Sales Header DataItem, in the **Data Source** field, enter the following expression: `FORMAT("Sales Header"."Prices Including VAT")`. In the **Name** field, enter **F\_Prices\_Including\_VAT**.  

3.  Select the **Prices Including VAT** row, choose **View**, choose **Properties**, and then verify that the [IncludeCaption Property](IncludeCaption-Property.md) is set to **No**. Save and compile the report.  

4.  On the **View** menu, choose **Layout**.  

5.  Right-click the cell that contains the Prices Including VAT value in the Sales Header item, and then choose **Expression**.  

6.  Delete the expression in the **Set expression for: Value** box.  

7.  In the **Expression** window, in the **Category** box, select **Fields\(DataSet\_Results\)**, and then in the **Values** box, double-click **F\_Prices\_Including\_VAT**.  

8.  Verify that the **Set expression for: Value** box contains the following expression: `=Fields!F_Prices_Including_VAT.Value`. Choose the **OK** button.  

#### To format the amount values  

1.  In the table that contains the Customer Ledger Entry data, select the cell that contains the **Amount** field.  

2.  In the **Properties** pane, locate the **Format** property, select the drop-down list, and then choose **Expression** to open the **Expression** window.  

3.  In the **Category** box, select **Fields\(DataSet\_Results\)**, and then in the **Values** box, double-click **Amount\_CustLedgerEntryFormat**.  

4.  Verify that the **Set expression for: Value** box contains the following expression: `=Fields!Amount_CustLedgerEntryFormat.Value`. Choose the **OK** button.  

5.  Repeat steps 1 through 4 and format the cells that contain Amount values as show in the following table. Make sure that you double-click the appropriate field in the **Values** box and verify that the **Set expression for: Value** box contains the expression for appropriate field.  

    |Table|Field|Fields\(DataSet\_Results\) Value to double-click|Set expression for: Value box|  
    |-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
    |Customer Ledger Entry|Original Amt. \(LCY\)|OriginalAmtLCY\_CustLedgerEntryFormat|=Fields\!OriginalAmtLCY\_CustLedgerEntryFormat.Value|  
    |Customer Ledger Entry|Remaining Amt.\(LCY\)|RemainingAmtLCY\_CustLedgerEntryFormat|=Fields\!RemainingAmtLCY\_CustLedgerEntryFormat.Value|  
    |Detailed Customer Ledger Entry|Amount \(LCY\)|AmountLCY\_DetailedCustLedgEntryFormat|=Fields\!AmountLCY\_DetailedCustLedgEntryFormat.Value|  
    |Detailed Customer Ledger Entry|Debit Amount \(LCY\)|DebitAmountLCY\_DetailedCustLedgEntryFormat|=Fields\!DebitAmountLCY\_DetailedCustLedgEntryFormat.Value|  
    |Detailed Customer Ledger Entry|Credit Amount \(LCY\)|CreditAmountLCY\_DetailedCustLedgEntryFormat|=Fields\!CreditAmountLCY\_DetailedCustLedgEntryFormat.Value|  
    |Sales Header|Amount|Amount\_SalesHeaderFormat|=Fields\!Amount\_SalesHeaderFormat.Value|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The field that displays the total amount uses the format of the **Amount** field in the **Customer Ledger Entry** table.  

#### To hide zero decimal values  

1.  Right-click the cell that displays the amount in the Sales header item, choose **Expression**, in the **Set expression for: Value** box, replace the expression with following expression: `=Code.BlankZero(Fields!Amount_SalesHeader.Value)`.
