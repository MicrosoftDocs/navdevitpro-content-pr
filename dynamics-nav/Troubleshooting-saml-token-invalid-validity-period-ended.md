# Troubleshooting: The SAML2 token is invalid because its validity period ended. 

 
Your deployment is using Access Control Service (ACS) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. A client is disconnected from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance, and  event log of the computer that is running of the server instance includes a warning event that has the following message: 
 
`The SAML2 token is invalid because its validity period ended.` 

## Resolution   
Azure AD issues a SAML security token which is used to authenticate client users. The security token has a lifetime, typically about 1 hour by default. When the lifetime expires, the client is disconnected from the server instance. If this issue becomes a problem, the server instance includes a configuration setting called **Extended Security Token Lifetime** (or ExtendedSecurityTokenLifetime) that you can set to increase the lifetime on hourly intervals, up to 24 hours. For more information, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md#AzureAd).
