#Working with the ML Prediction Management API
This topic describes the methods to use to prepare data for analysis, train the model on data and evaluate its quality, and make a prediction that is accompanied by a confidence score that indicates how accurate the prediction is. All of these methods are available in codeunit 2003.

##How to initialize the codeunit
The methods in the following table initialize codeunit 2003.

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|[Default Initialize](default-initialize.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[Initialize](initialize.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|

##Prepare your data
The methods in the following table prepare data.

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|[setRecord](set-record.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[addFeature](add-feature.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[setLabel](set-label.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[setTrainingPercent](set-training-percent.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[isDataSufficientForClassification](is-data-sufficient-for-classification.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|

## Create a Working Model 
The methods in the following table create a model that can generate predictions.

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|[train](train.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[evaluate](evaluate.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
|[predict](predict.md)|<short description, starts with a verb>|
