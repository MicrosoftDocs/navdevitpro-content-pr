# Getting Started
This topic describes the requirements for using the ML Prediction Management API.

## Data Requirements
You should have a couple of hundred records for late payments *and* on-time payments. The more the better. If you are not sure whether you have enough data, experiment with what you have, and try retraining, and then check the quality value for the model.


## Getting an Azure Subscription
You will use Azure Machine Learning Studio, so one of the first things you need to do is get a subscription to Azure. If you are just testing things out, the free subscription is probably enough. To learn more about Azure subscriptions, see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/trial/get-started-machine-learning/.
