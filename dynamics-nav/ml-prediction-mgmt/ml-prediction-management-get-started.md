# Getting Started
This topic describes the requirements for using ML Prediction Management tools.

## About Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
You will use Azure Machine Learning Studio, so one of the first things you need to do is get a subscription to Azure. In short, Machine Learning Studio combines data science, predictive analytics, cloud resources, and your data to help you build, test, and deploy predictive models as web services that you can integrate with other apps. You can also save them to Azure, and share (or sell) them.

Getting started ot just experimenting with Studio is easy. Go to the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/trial/get-started-machine-learning/) website and sign up for an account. If you just want to try it out, you can choose the free (green) model. The model is based in the South Central United States and has limited scalability, but itâ€™s fine for experimenting. Studio contains sample models, data, algorithms, data manipulation and transformation modules, R and Python runtime, and much more.
 
## About the Predictive Tools We Provide
The framework we provide gives developers access to advanced algorithms that process data to make predictions about the future state of one or more aspects of your business. For example, our Late Payment Prediction extension uses it to predict whether a customer will pay an invoice on-time. The components of the framework include two experiments in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery, and two codeunits in 

### About Our Experiments
Our ML experts have created two experiments that you can use to create your own model, or you can copy our model and modify it to suit your needs. Our model uses the Execute R Script module to run the R scripts that calculate forecasts and determine their accuracy.

The experiments are available in the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828352):

* Forecasting Model for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]  
* [Late Payment Prediction Model for for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]

### About the Codeunits We Provide
You can use the following codeunits when you build your own extension:

* Codeunit 2003 for payment predictions  
* Codeunit  <!--Need the codeunit number. Also, is this codeunit used for both sales and inventory forecasts and cash flow forecasts?-->

## Predictive Models
ML Prediction Management uses a classification model. The goal of a classification model is to assign something to a predefined class, or category. These classes or categories are called "labels," and are defined when you train the model. For this API, we have two labels, **Late** and **On-Time.**

## Data Requirements
The more data you have, the better. For example, the dataset we use to train the model for ML Prediction management needed two or three hundred records of both late and on-time payments. However, other factors such as variance also influence the accuracy of predictions. When you are determining whether you have enough data, for example, you might try removing some of your data and then retraining your model, or just train the model several times. Our models contain a check that examines the quality of a model. If you copy our model, you can decide whether the predictions are reliable enough to use.
