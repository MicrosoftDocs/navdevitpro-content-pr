# Welcome to the ML Prediction Management API Documentation
Learn how to create an experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio, build a predictive model, deploy the model as a web service, and then integrate the model with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)].

## About the ML Prediction Management API
The ML Prediction Management API provides developers with access to advanced algorithms that process data to make predictions about the future state of one or more aspects of your business. For example, our Late Payment Prediction extension uses the API to predict whether a customer will pay an invoice on-time.

## Food for Thought
An enterprise resource planning solution like [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../includes/d365fin_md.md)] contains plenty of opportunities to benefit from getting a peek into the future.

You can use the ML Prediction Management API to make predictions within specific business areas. For example, our Late Payment Predictions extension uses the API to predict whether a customer will pay an invoice on time. For more information, see [The Late Payment Prediction Extension]. 

There are plenty of ways to benefit from using this API with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Here are just a few predictions you might consider implementing:

* When an expected item receipt will be overdue.
* Whether a sales campaign will increase sales.
* Whether a resource will complete job on time.
