# Integrate With Cortana Intelligence
The quality and accuracy of the algorithms used in artificial intelligence (AI) and Azure machine learning (ML) are improving by leaps and bounds, and we see lots of ways to use them in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. The following extensions are examples of the features we already offer that use Azure services:
  
* **Sales and Inventory Forecasts** and **Cash Flow Forecasts** use a Time Series experiment to help you manage the movement of inventory and cash through your business. For more information, see [Sales and Inventory Forecasts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/financials/ui-extensions-sales-forecast) and [Set Up Cash Flow Forecasts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/financials/finance-setup-cash-flow-analyses).
* **Image Analyzer** uses the [Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) from Azure Cognitive Services to detect attributes in images attached to items and contact persons. For more information, see [The Image Analyzer Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/financials/ui-extensions-image-analyzer).
* **Late Payment Predictions** help you manage receivables by predicting whether invoices will be paid on-time. For more information, see [The Late Payment Predictions extension](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).

The following table provides an overview of the documentation for the tools that are currently available for integrating services from Cortana Intelligence with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md].
