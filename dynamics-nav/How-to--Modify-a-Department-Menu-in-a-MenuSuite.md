# How to: Modify a Department Menu in a MenuSuite
[!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] provides a basic MenuSuite that you can modify, or you can create a new MenuSuite from the basic MenuSuite. You modify an existing MenuSuite by designing it in Navigation Pane Designer. You can modify the shortcut menus, which typically represent a department area. You can modify the department menu either directly from the shortcut menu or in the **Menu Properties** window. This procedure describes how to modify a department menu in a MenuSuite. For more information about how to modify a menu item, see [How to: Modify Menu Items in a MenuSuite](How-to--Modify-Menu-Items-in-a-MenuSuite.md). For information about how to create a new MenuSuite, see [Walkthrough: Creating MenuSuites for the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows Client](Walkthrough--Creating-MenuSuites-for-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-Client.md).  
  
### To modify a department menu in a MenuSuite  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], choose **Tools** and then choose **Object Designer**.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, choose **MenuSuite**.  
  
3.  Choose the MenuSuite that you want to modify, and then choose **Design** to open Navigation Pane Designer.  
  
4.  In Navigation Pane Designer, select the department you want to modify, and open the shortcut menu. From here, you can make the following modifications:  
  
    -   Delete the department menu.  
  
    -   Rename the department menu.  
  
    -   Move the department menu to a different location.  
  
    -   Hide or show the department menu.  
  
    -   Disable or enable the department menu.  
  
    -   Change the properties \(Caption, CaptionML and Bitmap\) of the department menu in the **Menu Properties** window. Changing the caption in the **Menu Properties** window is the same as renaming the department.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  The department tabs are located at the bottom half of **Navigation Pane Designer**. The design level and the name of the department that you selected are shown at the top of Navigation Pane Designer.
