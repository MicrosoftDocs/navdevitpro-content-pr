# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Trace Events
This article provides an overview of the trace events that are generated by [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] server instance.

## Overview
-  There are two event trace providers that publish different trace events to the event log: **Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server** and **Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Common**. The trace events in this article are grouped according to their event trace provider. You typically need to provide this name in the monitoring tool that you are using.  
  
-   There are several types of trace events for each event trace provider, including: Windows event viewer, SQL traces, service calls, C/AL function calls, and telemetry. Trace event types are identified by a keyword with a corresponding decimal and hexadecimal value. The keywords and values enable you to collect data on specific trace events. Some tools support the hexadecimal values only and other tools support both hexadecimal and decimal.  
  
-   For some trace events, there is separate event for when an operation starts and when it stops. This enables you to determine the duration of the operation. Some monitoring tools, such as PerfView, will automatically return the duration in the stop event.  
  
-   Some monitoring tools might interpret and display the collected event trace differently than others. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  

## Windows Event Viewer Trace Events  
Windows Event Viewer trace events track errors, warnings, and information messages that provide information about the condition or state of [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances. These events can be viewed in the **DynamicsNAV** channel logs and **Application** log of Event Viewer on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. For more information, see [Monitoring Dynamics NAV Server Events Using Event Viewer](Monitoring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events-in-the-Windows-Event-Log.md). 
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server|EventViewer|1|0x1|  

For a list and description of EventViewer trace events, see [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Admin and Operational Events](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Events.md).

## SQL Trace Events  
SQL trace events track a specific set of SQL statements that are executed from the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance against the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database on SQL Server.  
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server|SQLTracing|2|0x2|  
  
The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user, and the SQL statement. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
The following table lists the SQL trace events.

## Service Call Trace Events  
 Service call trace events track when [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients run the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects: Queries, Reports, and XMLports.  
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|

|Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server|ServiceCall|4|0x4|  
  
The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user, and the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] object ID. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
The following table lists the service call trace events.  
  
|ID|Event \(task/opcode\)|What is traced|  
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------|  
|300|RunQuery/Start|[!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Query objects that are opened and closed.|

|501|CloseSession|[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]s and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]s establish a connection to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.|  
  
## C/AL Function Trace Events  
C/AL function tracing events track the execution of C/AL functions and statements on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.  
  
|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Server|ALTracing|8|0x8|  
  
The event data that is collected includes: session ID, tenant ID, [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user, C/ALC/AL function, C/AL statements, and line number. For more information, see [Event Trace Data](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Trace-Events.md#ArgRef).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is not configured for full C/AL function tracing, then only root-level C/AL function will be traced. Statements and C/AL functions that are called from functions will not be traced. By default, the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is not configured for full C/AL functionf tracing. For information about how to specify full C/AL function tracing, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).  
  
The following table lists the C/AL function tracing events.  
  
|ID|Event \(task/opcode\)|What is traced|  
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------|  
|400|ExecuteALFunction/Start|C/AL functions that are called.| |401|ExecuteALFunction/Stop|C/AL functions that are called.|  
|402|ExecuteALFunctionFailed|Errors that occur when executing C/AL functions. The errors can be caused by exceptions or [ERROR Function \(Dialog\)](ERROR-Function--Dialog-.md) calls.|  
|403|ExecuteALFunction|C/AL statements that are executed.<br /><br /> **Important:** This trace event is only traced when the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] is configured to full C/AL function tracing.|  

## Telemetry Trace Events

Telemetry trace events provide data about the application functions and how it is being used in production. These events include both system telemetry trace events and custom telemetry trace events. 

|Event trace provider|Keyword|Decimal value|Hexadecimal value|  
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|  
|Microsoft-DynamicsNAV-Common|TelemetryTracing|32|0x20|  

Custom telemetry trace events are emitted from the application. These are events that are sent by [SENDTRACETAG function](sendtracetag-function.md) calls from inside the application. For more information about custom telemetry trace events, see [Instrumenting av Application for Telemetry](instrumenting-application-for-telemetry.md)].  

##  <a name="ArgRef"></a> Event Trace Data  
 The following table lists the arguments that make up the data collected for trace events. When viewing event trace data, the way that the arguments are interpreted and displayed can vary depending on the tool that you use.
