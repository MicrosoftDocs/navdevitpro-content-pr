# Integrating Dynamics 365 for Sales in Dynamics NAV
[!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] enables seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process for customers who use [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] for customer engagement and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] for order processing and financials. Tight integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] provides the following capabilities:  

-   Enables users to work in both [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

    User can view the data for equivalent records, such as [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] customers and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts from either system. They can work in the application that they prefer and are most efficient in, and make more informed decisions without switching applications.  

-   Data can be shared and synchronized between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)].  

    Changes to records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts, can be copied to corresponding records in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], such as customers. This enables users to keep information up-to-date in both applications.  

## Features of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] Integration  
[!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration enables you to couple [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] records with [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] records - essentially linking the records together. Once coupled, you can access [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] records from [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] and, for some entities, access [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] records from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] (see the note after the following table). You can also synchronize data between records so that data is the same in both systems.

> [!NOTE]  
> For [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] fields of type Option, only records for options that also exist in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] can be synchronized. During synchronization, such non-mapped options are ignored, the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] table and added to the **CRM Option Mapping** system table for manual handling later, for example by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping. For more information, see [Handling Missing Option Values in Mapping](Handling Missing Option Values in Mapping.md).

The following table describes the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] entities that are integrated with [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] record types (tables) in the default implementation and the supported features.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Navigating from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] records is only supported if the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] integration solution is installed in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
