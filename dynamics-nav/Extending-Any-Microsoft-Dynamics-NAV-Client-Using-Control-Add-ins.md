# Extending Any Microsoft Dynamics NAV Client Using Control Add-ins
With [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] you can write control add-ins that add custom functionality to Role Centers and pages on all display targets, using the same extensibility framework. The following sections provide an overview of the documentation that is available to develop and use control add-ins.  
  
 Control add-ins that are designed with [!INCLUDE[navsicily](includes/navsicily_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[navcrete](includes/navcrete_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[navcorfu](includes/navcorfu_md.md)] using a .NET 4.5 assembly and a manifest file, can be used on all display targets. Control add-ins that were written for earlier versions, will still run on the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Javascript-based client add-ins in repeater controls, such as lists, listparts, list subpages, and worksheets, are not supported on any of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To support control add-ins running in IE7 mode, you can enable a key in the ClientUserSettings.config file. For more information, see the **Settings in the ClientUserSettings.config file** section in [Configuring the Windows Client](Configuring-the-Windows-Client.md).
