# DELCHR Function (Code, Text)
Deletes one or more characters in a string.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
NewString := DELCHR(String[, Where][, Which])  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *String*  
 Type: Text constant or code  
  
 The input string.  
  
 *Where*  
 Type: Text constant or code  
  
 Specifies where to delete characters.  
  
 You can include one or more of the following characters in the *Where* string:  
  
-   `=`   To delete any character in *String* that matches a character in *Which* (default)  
  
-   `<`   To delete any leading character in *String* that matches a character in *Which*  
  
-   `>`   To delete any trailing character in *String* that matches a character in *Which*  
  
 *Which*  
 Type: Text or code  
  
 Specifies the characters that you want to delete.  
  
 The default is a space character.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Text constant or code  
  
 The resulting string.  
  
## Remarks  
 The DELCHR function is case-sensitive.  
  
 If you omit the *Which* parameter, then the function deletes spaces from *String* based on the contents of the *Where* parameter as follows:  
  
-   If *Where* contains =, then all the spaces are deleted from *String*.  
  
-   If *Where* contains <, then all the spaces at the start of *String* are deleted.  
  
-   If *Where* contains >, then all the spaces at the end of *String* are deleted.  
  
-   If *Where* contains any other character, then an error is returned.  
  
-   If *Where* is empty, then *String* is returned unchanged.  
  
 If you use the *Where* and the *Which* parameters, then the function deletes from *String* the characters that are contained in the *Which* parameter based on the contents of the *Where* parameter as follows:  
  
-   If *Where* contains =, then every occurrence of the characters in *Which* are deleted from *String*.  
  
-   If *Where* contains \<, then the characters in *Which* are only deleted if they occur at the start of *String*.  
  
-   If *Where* contains >, then the characters in *Which* are deleted only if they occur at the end of *String*.  
  
-   If *Where* contains any other character, then an error is returned.  
  
-   If *Where* is empty, then *String* is returned unchanged.  
  
-   If *Which* is empty, then *String* is returned unchanged.  
  
 The *Which* parameter contains an array of the characters that you want to delete. The order of the characters is of no significance. If *String* contains a character that is specified in *Which*, it is deleted from *String*.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following variables and text constants in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|String|Text|  
|Where|Text|  
|Which|Text|  
|NewString|Text|  
  
|Text constant name|ConstValue|  
|------------------------|----------------|  
|Text000|Windy West Solutions|  
|Text001|>%1\< is transformed to >%2\<|  
  
```  
String := Text000;  
Where := '<>';  
Which := 'Ws';  
NewString := DELCHR(String, Where, Which);  
MESSAGE(Text001, String,NewString);  
```  
  
 The message window displays the following:  
  
 **>Windy West Solutions\< is transformed to >indy West Solution\<**  
  
 The function deletes every W and s that is either the first or last character in *String*.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following variables and text constants in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|String|Text|  
|Where|Text|  
|Which|Text|  
|NewString|Text|  
  
|Text constant name|ConstValue|  
|------------------------|----------------|  
|Text000|This is an example|  
|Text001|>%1\< is transformed to >%2\<|  
  
```  
String := Text000;  
Where := '=';  
Which := 'sx';  
NewString := DELCHR(String, Where, Which);  
MESSAGE(Text001, String,NewString);  
```  
  
 The message window displays the following:  
  
 **>This is an example\< is transformed to >Thi i an eample\<**  
  
 The function deletes every s and x from *String*.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following variables and text constants in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|String|Text|  
|Where|Text|  
|Which|Text|  
|NewString|Text|  
  
|Text constant name|ConstValue|  
|------------------------|----------------|  
|Text000|This is an example|  
|Text001|>%1\< is transformed to >%2\<|  
  
```  
String := Text000;  
Where := '>';  
Which := 'Tely';  
NewString := DELCHR(String, Where, Which);  
MESSAGE(Text001, String,NewString);  
```  
  
 The message window displays the following:  
  
 **>This is an example\< is transformed to >This is an examp\<**  
  
 If T, e, l, or y is the last character in *String*, the function deletes them.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following variables and text constants in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|String|Text|  
|Where|Text|  
|Which|Text|  
|NewString|Text|  
  
|Text constant name|ConstValue|  
|------------------------|----------------|  
|Text000|This is an example|  
|Text001|>%1\< is transformed to >%2\<|  
  
```  
String := Text000;  
Where := '<';  
Which := 'This';  
NewString := DELCHR(String, Where, Which);  
MESSAGE(Text001, String,NewString);  
```  
  
 The message window displays the following:  
  
 **>This is an example\< is transformed to >an example\<**  
  
 If T, h, s, i, or space is the first character in *String*, the function deletes them.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following variables and text constants in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|String|Text|

```  
  
 The message window displays the following:  
  
 **>     This is an example\< is transformed to >This is an example\<**  
  
 The function removes any spaces from the start of *String*.
