# MODIFY Function (Record)
Modifies a record in a table.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
[Ok :=] Record.MODIFY([RunTrigger])  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Record*  
 Type: Record  
  
 The record that you want to modify.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  The record cannot be from table 2000000001, the **Object** table or table 2000000006, the **Company** table.  
  
 *RunTrigger*  
 Type: Boolean  
  
 Specifies whether to run the C/AL code in the [OnModify Trigger](OnModify-Trigger.md).  
  
 If this parameter is **true**, then the code in the **OnModify** trigger is executed. If this parameter is **false** \(default\), then the code in the **OnModify** trigger is not executed.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  
  
 **true** if the record was modified; otherwise, **false**.  
  
 If you omit this optional return value and if the record is not found, then a run-time error occurs. If you include the return value, then you must handle any errors.  
  
## Remarks  
 If an end-user modifies a record between the time that another end-user or another process reads the record and modifies it, then the second user must refresh the value of the record variable before editing the record. Otherwise, the end-user receives the following run-time error:  
  
 **Another user has modified the record for this \<Table Name> after you retrieved it from the database.**  
  
 **Enter your changes again in the updated window, or start the interrupted activity again.**  
  
 In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], certain situations allowed code that an end-user runs to modify a record after a newer version of the record was written and committed to the database. This would overwrite the newer changes. However, in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], we have restricted the **MODIFY** Function \(Record\), [RENAME Function \(Record\)](RENAME-Function--Record-.md), and [DELETE Function \(Record\)](DELETE-Function--Record-.md) so that the end-user receives the following run-time error in these certain situations:  
  
 **Unable to change an earlier version of the \<Table Name> record. The record should be read from the database again. This is a programming error.**  
  
 You must design your application so that you use the most up-to-date version of the record for modifications to the database. You use the [GET Function \(Record\)](GET-Function--Record-.md) to refresh the record with the latest version. The second example that is shown here illustrates this situation.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following variables and text constants in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|Subtype|  
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|  
|CustomerRec|Record|Customer|  
|No1|Integer|Not applicable|  
|No2|Integer|Not applicable|  
  
|Text constant|ConstValue|  
|-------------------|----------------|  
|Text000|The customer no. %1 is:\\|  
|Text001|Now customer no. %1 is:\\|  
  
```  
// Find customer.  
CustomerRec.FIND('-');  
// Display name.  
MESSAGE(Text000 + '%2', CustomerRec."No.", CustomerRec.Name);  
// Modify customer name.  
CustomerRec.Name := 'Progressive Home Furnishings';  
CustomerRec.MODIFY;  
// Display new name.  
MESSAGE(Text001 + '%2', CustomerRec."No.", CustomerRec.Name);  
```  
  
 Messages that resemble the following are displayed:  
  
 **The customer no. AAA 1050 is:**  
  
 **AAA Furniture Manufacturing**  
  
 **Now customer no. AAA 1050 is:**  
  
 **Progressive Home Furnishings**  
  
## Example  
 This example shows that you get an error if you attempt to modify a record after a newer version of the record has been written and committed to the database. This example requires that you create the following variables in the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|Subtype|  
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|  
|CustomerRec1|Record|Customer|  
|CustomerRec2|Record|Customer|  
  
 In this example, you get a copy of a record from the Customer table and put it into the CustomerRec1 variable, then you modify the record. Next, you get a copy of the same record from the Customer table and put it into the CustomerRec2 variable. You modify the record and commit the changes to the database. Now the CustomerRec1 variable is out of date with the value in the database. If you were allowed to modify the database with the CustomerRec1 record, then the Phone No. field that you modified with CustomerRec2 would be overwritten by the old value of the Phone No. field that is in the CustomerRec1 variable. [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] does not allow you to modify the database with the old version of the record.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you do not call the COMMIT function in this example, then you do not receive an error.  
  
```  
CustomerRec1.LOCKTABLE;  
CustomerRec1.GET('10000');  
CustomerRec1."Address 2" := 'Suite 101';  
CustomerRec1.MODIFY;  
  
CustomerRec2.GET('10000');  
CustomerRec2."Phone No.":= '206-555-0109';  
CustomerRec2.MODIFY;  
  
COMMIT;  
  
CustomerRec1."Salesperson Code" := 'JR';  
CustomerRec1.MODIFY;  
```  
  
 If you run this code example, then you get the following error:  
  
 **Unable to change an earlier version of the Customer record. The record should be read from the database again. This is a programming error.**  
  
 **Identification fields and values:**  
  
 **No.='10000'**
