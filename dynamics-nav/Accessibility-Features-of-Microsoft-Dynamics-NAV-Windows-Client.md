# Accessibility Features of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows Client
Microsoft is committed to making its products and services easier for everyone to use. This topic provides information about features of the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] that makes the product more accessible for people with disabilities.  

## Keyboard Shortcuts  
 Instead of using a mouse or another pointing device, the keyboard can sometimes be a faster way to perform a task. For a list of the keyboard shortcuts that can be used in the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], see [Keyboard Shortcuts](Keyboard-Shortcuts.md).  

## Assistive technologies  
 [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] supports various assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice recognition software.  

## Ribbon  
 With the introduction of the ribbon in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], the navigation through menus and actions has now become easier using the keyboard. Use the F6 key to navigate through the different frames in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]; use Shift+F6 to navigate backwards. To display all the access keys in the ribbon, press the Alt key.  

## Help  
 [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help offers features that make help more accessible. For more information, see [Microsoft Accessibility](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=262160).  

## For more accessibility information
