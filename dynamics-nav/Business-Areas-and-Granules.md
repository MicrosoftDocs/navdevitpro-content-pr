# Business Areas and Granules
[!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] contains business areas. You can control how the license file controls the access that you have to these business areas and the functionality that they contain.  
  
## Business Areas and Granules  
 The standard [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] application is divided into several business areas. Each business area consists of a number of functional areas. These functional areas contain functionality; however different customers might only need some of the functionality that is provided. To facilitate this, a [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] license file contains a number of granules. Each granule represents a small area of functionality.  
  
 This system makes it possible for each customer to purchase a license that only gives the company and the company's employees access to exactly the functionality needed.
