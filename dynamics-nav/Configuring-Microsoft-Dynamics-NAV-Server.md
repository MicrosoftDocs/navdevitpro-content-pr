# Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](includes/nav2018_md.md)]. [See [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] version](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-2017.md).

When you run [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup and install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you provide information that is then used as the configuration for the default [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. This information is stored in a configuration file for the server instance called CustomSetting.config. The default location of the CustomSettings.config file is *[!INCLUDE[navnow_install_md](includes/navnow_install_md.md)]\Service*. 

After you install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can change any of the settings that you provided during Setup, plus several other settings that were not available to you in Setup.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Each [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance has its own CustomSettings.config file.  

## Configuring [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] in Setup 
You configure the default instance of [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] by running [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup and selecting one of the following [Installation Options](Installation-Options.md): 

-   [Demo Option](Demo-Option.md)
-   [Server Option](Server-Option.md)
-   [Developer Option](Developer-Option.md)  

You can also customize your installation and the list of components to install. For more information, see [How to: Choose Components to Install](How-to--Choose-Components-to-Install.md).  

After you specify an installation option or customize your component list, the **Specify parameters** pane is displayed in Setup. The list of parameters that you see in the **Specify parameters** pane depends on which components you have selected for configuration. Setup provides a short description for each parameter. For a description of the most important parameters for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], see [Server Option](Server-Option.md). When you have finished entering values, choose the **Apply** button. 

## Configuring [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] After Installation  
After you install [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], you can change the configuration settings in the CustomSettings.config file of a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance in the following ways:  

-   Using the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].

    For more information, see [Settings in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Console](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md#NavAdminSettings) and [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Administration Tool](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Administration-Tool.md).  

-   Using the [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=401394) that is available in the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)].

    For more information, see [Using Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell Cmdlets to Modify Settings](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md#UsingPowerShell).  

-   By directly editing CustomSettings.config using a text editor.

    We recommend that you do not directly edit the configuration file, because if you make any errors in typing, then you may not be able to start the instance.  

### Restarting [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] after modifications

If you use the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] or modify the CustomSettings.config file directly, you must restart the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance before any changes can take effect.

If you use the [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=401394), whether you need to restart the server instance will depend on the configuration setting that you change. There are several settings that are *dynamically updatable*, which means that a server instance restart is not necessariyl required after modification. For more information, see [Modifying dynamically updatable settings](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md#DynamicSettings). In the tables that follow, these settings are indicated by the text **Dynamically Updatable: Yes**.

##  <a name="NavAdminSettings"></a>[!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] Instance Settings  
This section describes all the configuration settings for a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. The settings are grouped according to the tabs under which they appear in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].
-   The **Setting** column displays the name of the setting as it appears in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].
-   The **Key Name** column displays the name of the setting as it appears in the CustomSettings.config file, and is also the name to use for the setting when using the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet.

###  <a name="General"></a> General Settings  
The following table describes fields on the **General** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].  

|Setting|Key Name|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Build Restriction|ClientBuildRestriction|Specifies what happens when a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client tries to connect to the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance when the client is running a different build version of [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] than the server instance.<br /><br /> Values:<br /><br />**AlwaysConnect**<br /><br />**WarnClient**<br /> Before connecting the client to the server instance, a message appears that informs the user that the build versions for the client and server instance are different. The user can choose to continue or cancel the connection.<br /><br /> **DoNotAllow**<br /> A message appears that informs the user that the client and server instance build versions are different, and the client does not connect to the server instance.<br /><br /> **Note:** With the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)], this setting compares the build version of the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] on IIS with the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. It controls the connection between [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] and the server instance.<br /><br /> Default: WarnClient<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Certificate Thumbprint|ServicesCertificateThumbprint|If you use security certificates to protect communications between [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] and client services or web services over an open or wide-area network, you must provide the certificate thumbprint to [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] by updating this setting. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Implementing Security Certificates in a Test Environment](Walkthrough--Implementing-Security-Certificates-in-a-Test-Environment.md) and [How to: Implement Security Certificates in a Production Environment](How-to--Implement-Security-Certificates-in-a-Production-Environment.md).<br /><br />Default: WarnClient<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Compile and Load Business Application|CompileBusinessApplicationAtStartup|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance compiles all the business application assemblies and loads them to cache memory when the server instance is started. The assemblies are then retrieved from memory when requested by a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client.<br /><br /> Enabling this setting will reduce the time it takes for the server instance to load application objects the first time they are requested by a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client after the server instance started. However, it will also slightly increase the memory usage by the server instance.<br /><br />If you enable this setting, when the server instance starts for the first time, the business application assemblies will be compiled and loaded to the cache memory of the computer that is running the server instance. The assemblies, along with metadata such object timestamp information, are also stored to a temporary folder on the computer's file system. Whenever the server instance is restarted, it will compare the assemblies that are stored in memory with corresponding objects in the connected database to determine whether the assemblies in memory can be reused. An assembly will be reused if the following conditions are met:<br /><br />- The connected database is the same as before, based on the *databasemagic* field in the dbproperty table.<br /><br />- The object time stamp that is recorded on the compiled assembly matches the object timestamp in metadata of the connected database.<br /><br />If the conditions are not met for an assembly or an assembly for an object in the database is not found in the memory, then a new assembly is built and stored for reuse to cache memory and the file system of the server instance compute for reuse.<br /><br />If you disable this setting, individual assemblies will be compiled on-demand as application objects are requested by the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client. The compiled assemblies will not be reused on subsequent server instance restarts.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>This setting does not apply to query objects.</li><li>Assembly compilation happens asynchronously.</li><li>On average, all application objects will be loaded within the first few minutes that the server instance operates.</li></ul><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|  
|Credential Type|ClientServicesCredentialType|Specifies the authentication mechanism for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] users of this [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br /><br /> The options are **Windows**, **Username**, **NavUserPassword**, **AccessControlService**, and **None**. For more information, see [Users and Credential Types](Users-and-Credential-Types.md).<br /><br /> If you choose **AccessControlService**, you must specify a token signing key for use with Azure Access Control service \(ACS\), or a federation metadata location for use with Azure AD. If you choose **NavUserPassword**, and you specify a token signing key, you can use both NavUserPassword and AccessControlService for this server instance.<br /><br />Notes:<ul><li>**None** is for internal use on system sessions and typically should not be used. If you choose **None**, then the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance cannot start.</li><li>**ExchangeIdentity** and **TaskScheduler** are for internal use only, and should not be used.</li></ul><br />Default: Windows<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|

|  Enable Save as Word on Request Pages of RDLC-layout Reports  | EnableSaveToWordForRdlcReports| Specifies whether users can open or save a report as a Microsoft Word document if the report uses an RDLC layout.<br /><br /> If you clear this check box, the **Word** option is removed from the **Print** menu on the request page.<br /><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|  Enable Save from Report Preview  | EnableSaveFromReportPreview| Specifies whether users can save a report as a PDF, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft Excel document from the report preview window.<br /><br />If you clear this check box, the **Save As** icon is removed from the report preview window.<br /><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
| Report PDF Font Embedding  |ReportPDFFontEmbedding|  Specifies whether fonts are embedded in PDF files that are generated for reports when the report uses an RDLC report layout at runtime. This setting applies when reports are run and saved as PDF files on the client (from the report request page or print preview window) or on the server instance (by the [SAVEAS function](SAVEAS-Function.md) or [SAVEASPDF function](SAVEASPDF-Function--Report-.md) in C/AL code).<br /><br />**Note:** This setting does not apply when a report uses a Word report layout at runtime.<br/><br/>Embedding fonts in a PDF of a report makes sure that the PDF will use the same fonts as the original file, regardless of where the PDF is opened and which fonts are installed on the computer. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the PDF files. By disabling font embedding, you can decrease the size of the report PDF files.<br /><br />**Note:** This is a global setting for font embedding in report PDF files. You can override this setting on a report basis by the specifying the [PDFFontEmbedding property](PDFFontEmbedding-Property.md).<br /><br />Default: Enabled<br />Dynamically Updatable: No| 

### Development Settings
The following table describes fields on the **Development** tab in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)].

|  Setting  |Key Name|  Description  |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
|Allowed Extension Target Level|ExtensionAllowedTargetLevel| Specifies the allowed target level when publishing extensions. The options are **Internal**, **Extension**, **Solution**, and **Personalization**. <br /> <br />- If you specify the  **Internal** option, the allowed compilation target is set to everything on-premises. The **Internal** setting allows using all restricted APIs. The `target` setting in the `app.json` file must also be set to **Internal**. For more information, see [JSON Files](developer/devenv-json-files.md).<br /><br />- If you specify the **Extension** option, the allowed extension target level is set to SaaS. <br /><br />- By adding the setting ``"target":"Extension"`` in the manifest enables you to submit the extension to AppSource. <br /><br /> The **Personalization** and **Solution** settings are currently for internal use only. <br /><br />**Note:** It is recommended to use either **Internal** or **Extension** options to set Allowed Extension Target Level. <br /><br />Default: Internal<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|Enable Developer Service Endpoint|DeveloperServicesEnabled|Specifies whether the Developer service endpoint is enabled. This setting must be enabled to publish extensions and download symbols.<br /><br />- If the check box is selected, the extension can be published to the allowed extension target level. <br /><br />- If the check box is not selected, the extension cannot be published.<br /><br />- This setting can also be controlled from the .xml file.<br /><br /> Default: Not enabled (check box is cleared)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|Enable Loading Application Symbol References at Server Startup|EnableSymbolLoadingAtServerStartup|Specifies whether application symbol references should be loaded at server startup. This setting must be enabled to allow any symbol generation. If the setting is not enabled, the **generatesymbolreference** setting does not have any effect. For more information, see [Running C/SIDE and AL Side-by-Side](developer/devenv-running-cside-and-al-side-by-side.md).<br /><br />Default: Not enabled (check box is cleared)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|Enable SSL|DeveloperServicesSSLEnabled|Specifies whether SSL (HTTPS) is enabled for the developer web service port. <br /><br />SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) secures the connection for the web services. <br /><br />- If the check box is selected, then SSL is enabled. <br /><br />- If the check box is not selected, the developer web service port cannot establish a secure connection. <br /><br />Default: Not enabled (check box is cleared)<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|
|HttpClient AL Function Maximum Timeout|NavHttpClientMaxTimeout|Specifies the maximum allowed timeout value that can be set for the HttpClient Timeout AL function.<br /><br />The value has the format HH:MM:SS.<br /><br />Default: 00:05:00<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|HttpClient AL Function Response Size|NavHttpClientMaxResponseContentSize|Specifies the maximum size in megabytes of a response buffer used by the HttpClient AL function.<br /><br />The maximum allowed extension size can be adjusted based on the HttpClient AL Function Maximum Timeout setting.<br /><br />Default: 15<br />Dynamically Updatable: Yes|
|Port|DeveloperServicesPort|The listening HTTP port for Microsoft Dynamics NAV Developer web services.<br /><br />Valid range: 1 - 65535<br />Default: 7049<br />Dynamically Updatable: No|


##  <a name="UsingPowerShell"></a> Using [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] to Modify Server Instance Settings  
The [!INCLUDE[nav_shell](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] includes several `Set-` cmdlets that enable you to create and modify [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instances.

The main cmdlet for configuring a server instance is the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet. You can use this cmdlet to change any of the configuration settings that are listed in the previous sections. To change a configuration setting, you set `-KeyName` parameter to the **Key Name** that corresponds to the setting, and set the `-KeyValue`parameter to the new value. For example, you can change the value for `DatabaseServer` to `DatabaseServer.Domain.Com` for the server instance named `MyInstance` by executing this cmdlet:  

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance "MyInstance" -KeyName "DatabaseServer" -KeyValue "DatabaseServer.Domain.Com"  
```  

### <a name="DynamicSettings"></a>Modifying dynamically updatable settings
For dynamically updatable settings, use the `-ApplyTo` parameter to specify how to apply the change. The change can be written directly to the configuration file (CustomSettings.config) and/or applied to the current server instance state. The option you choose will determine whether a server instance restart is required for the change to take effect. The parameter has three options, as described in the following table:

|  Option |Description  |
|-----------|-----------|
|ConfigFile|Saves the change to the configuration file of the server instance. The change will not take effect until the server instance is restarted.|
|Memory|Applies the change only to the server instance's current state. The changes take effect immediately, without having to restart the server instance. The change is stored in memory, so the next time the server instance is restarted, it reverts to the setting in the configuration file.|
|All|Applies the change to the server instance's current setting state (in memory) and to the configuration file. The changes take effect immediately, without having to restart the server instance.|

For example, the following command sets the value for the `MaxStreamReadSize` key to `42424242`, without having to restart the server instance. 

```  
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstanceMyInstance -KeyName MaxStreamReadSize -KeyValue 42424242 -ApplyTo Memory  
```
