# Demo Option
The **Install Demo** option is available on the first page after you accept the Microsoft Software License Terms in [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup. When you choose **Install Demo**, Setup installs all three tiers of the [Product and Architecture Overview](Product-and-Architecture-Overview.md) on the local computer.  

 The Demo Install is intended for users who want to try the features of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. We do not recommend this as the foundation for an actual production environment.  

> [!WARNING]  
>  You must install the Demo on a computer that uses a 64-bit Windows operating system.  

## Demo Install Option Notes  

-   When you choose **Demo Install**, Setup begins to copy files. After this, you have no additional interaction with Setup. Choose **Close** to exit Setup when it is finished copying files.  

-   Setup installs SQL Server 2016 Express, creates a SQL Server instance, **NAVDEMO**, and installs the **Demo Database NAV \(10-0\)** in this instance. Previous versions of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] installed the Demo database in the default SQL Server instance.  

     The first time that you install [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], the new SQL Server instance and Demo database are created automatically. If you subsequently delete [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] and then run Setup to install the Demo version again, Setup prompts you to replace the existing database:  

     `The SQL Server Instance “NAVDEMO” already has an instanced named ‘Demo Database NAV (10-0)’. Would you like to replace this database?`  

     You can choose **OK** or **Cancel**.  

-   Setup cannot install the data file for a database, an .mdf file, to the local computer if the destination folder or drive is compressed.  

## Installed Components  
 When you choose the Demo Install option, Setup installs the following components:  

-   [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  

     For more information, see [Client Types](Client-Types.md).  

-   [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server](Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server.md).  

-   [Development Environment (C/SIDE)](Development-Environment--C-SIDE-.md).  

-   Microsoft Office Excel Add-In.  

-   SQL Server Express, a smaller-scale version of SQL Server. If a valid version of SQL Server is already present on the computer where you are installing the Demo version, Setup does not install SQL Server Express.  

-   [SQL Server Database Components](SQL-Server-Database-Components.md).  

-   [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)], with a demo license. For information about what you can do with this license, see [Properties of the Demo License](Properties-of-the-Demo-License.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, the **Install Demo** option does not install the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help Server or the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)]. If you want these options, you can run the installation program again, choose the **Custom** option, and then choose the option that you want.
