# ($ S_2150 Control Add-ins $)
Contains control add\-ins that have been registered.  
  
 To register an add\-in, you include it on the **Control Add\-ins** page in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. A *control add\-in* is a Microsoft .NET Framework assembly that enables you to add custom functionality to the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] clients. After you have registered a control add\-in, you can use it on [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] pages. You select the control add\-in from this window and add it to a field control on the page.
