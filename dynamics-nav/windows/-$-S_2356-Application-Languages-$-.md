# ($ S_2356 Application Languages $)
Lists the languages that are included in your license and installed on your computer.  
  
 To open this window, on the **Tools** menu, choose **Language**.  
  
 The languages are used for captions in windows, on command buttons, and in other user interface \(UI\) elements. You can change the language from both the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. For more information about how to change a language, see [How to: Change the Language in the User Interface](../Topic/How%20to:%20Change%20the%20Language%20in%20the%20User%20Interface.md).
