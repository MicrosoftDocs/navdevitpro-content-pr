# ($ S_21408 Page Preview $)
Previews a page directly from Page Designer to see how the page will look in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)]. Unlike running a page from Object Designer, previewing a page does not start the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], which means that you can keep working in the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Preview Pages and Identify Page and Action Controls](../Topic/How%20to:%20Preview%20Pages%20and%20Identify%20Page%20and%20Action%20Controls.md).  
  
 To open this window, open Page Designer, and then choose the **Preview** button.
