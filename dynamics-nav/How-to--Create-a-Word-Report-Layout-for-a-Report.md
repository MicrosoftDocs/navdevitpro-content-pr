# Creating a Word Report Layout for a Report
After you design a dataset for a report, you can create a Word report layout that can be used when you view and print a report from the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client. This topic describes how to create blank a Word report layout on a report from the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)]. After you create the layout, you can modify the layout to include dataset fields and define the general format.  
  
### To create a Word report layout for a report  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], open the report in Report Dataset Designer as follows.  
  
    1.  On the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
    2.  In Object Designer, choose **Report**, select the report, and then choose the **Design** button.  
  
2.  On the **Tools** menu, choose **Word Layout**, and then choose **New**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **New** item is inactive, then the report already has a Word report layout.  
  
3.  Save the report object.  
  
 A blank Word report layout is created on the report object. The report layout includes a custom XML part for the current report dataset. You can now design the layout in Word. For more information, see [How to: Modify a Word Report Layout](How-to--Modify-a-Word-Report-Layout.md).
