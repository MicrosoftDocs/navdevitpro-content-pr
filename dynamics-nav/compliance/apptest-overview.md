# Rules and Guidelines for AL Code

This page defines the rules and guidelines to follow when writing AL code in an extension package. The rules and guidelines are grouped according to two importance levels: critical errors that must be resolved, and important errors that should be resolved. Errors that are not resolved must include an explanation and justification for the error.

## Critical Errors

- Code uses NAV encryption key functions, IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY, EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY, CREATEENCRYPTIONKEY, DELETEENCRYPTIONKEY. (It is fine to use the ENCRYPT and DECRYPT functions.)
- Code uses ASSERTERROR
- External data connections do not properly handle sensitive data
- Code uses AutoIncrement=Yes for a table field that may be used in a Foreign Key relationship. Recommend code comment that the table field will not be used in a Foreign Key relationship to pass validation
- Doesnâ€™t encrypt sensitive table data. (i.e. credit card info, passwords, etc.)

## Important Errors

- Temporary files are not cleaned up after use
- Code uses codeunits that require printers to be selected
- Code uses a specific time zone or locale
