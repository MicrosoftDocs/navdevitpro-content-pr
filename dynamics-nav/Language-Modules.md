# Language Modules
To view [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] in multiple languages, you install one or more language modules. The topic describes language modules in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. For more information about how to install language modules in the original version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], see [Language Modules for Microsoft Dynamics NAV](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=157364) \(requires PartnerSource login\).  
  
## Language Modules in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]  
 A language module contains:  
  
-   Translated strings for the UI in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  
  
-   Translated strings for the database.  
  
-   Translated strings for [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], such as for logs and error reporting.  
  
-   Translated strings for the Microsoft Office Outlook Add-in for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].  
  
-   Translated strings for charts on Role Centers in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  
  
-   Localized versions of the client Help.  
  
 Language modules are binary files that you cannot modify with external tools.  
  
 For more information about installing language modules in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], see [How to: Install Language Modules](How-to--Install-Language-Modules.md).  
  
 If you have customized [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], then after you install the appropriate language module, you should also translate the strings for the objects that you added or modified. For more information, see [How to: Add Translated Strings By Importing and Exporting Multilanguage Files](How-to--Add-Translated-Strings-By-Importing-and-Exporting-Multilanguage-Files.md) and [How to: Add Translated Strings By Using the Multilanguage Editor](How-to--Add-Translated-Strings-By-Using-the-Multilanguage-Editor.md).  
  
### Language Subdirectory  
 When you install a language module, a subdirectory for the language is created in the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] directory structure. The .stx, .etx, .chm, and .hh files for each language are automatically installed in the subdirectory. The name of the subdirectory is the three-letter language code \(Abbreviated Name\) that is used by Windows for the particular language. For more information, see [Windows Language Virtual Table](Windows-Language-Virtual-Table.md).
