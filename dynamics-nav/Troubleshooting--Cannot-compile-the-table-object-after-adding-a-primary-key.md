# Troubleshooting: Cannot compile the table object after adding a primary key
After adding a primary key to a table, you cannot compile the table object.  
  
## Resolution  
 This error can occur when the record size is close to the maximum value. The maximum record size in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] is 8000 bytes. To resolve this issue, limit the number of primary keys.
