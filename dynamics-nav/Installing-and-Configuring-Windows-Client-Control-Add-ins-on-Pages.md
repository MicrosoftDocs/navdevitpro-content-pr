# Installing and Configuring Windows Client Control Add-ins on Pages
In the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], control add-ins add custom controls or visual elements, on Windows client page fields for displaying and editing data. When a control add-in is developed, it is compiled into a .NET Frameworkâ€“based assembly, which is .dll file. To use a control add-in on [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] pages, you must install and configure the control add-in assembly in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] environment, which is divided between two tiers: [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] SQL Server database.
