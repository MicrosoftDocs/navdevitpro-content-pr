# Integrate a 3rd Party Solution
If you are an ISV with an existing service offering, then there are several reasons why you should choose to integrate your service with [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]:

- [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] exposes many “ready-to-use” APIs for Connect apps to make a seamless integration between your service offering and [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]. 

- Bundle your services with a [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] offering and give your customers an integrated experience that increases the value for their investment. 

- Use Microsoft AppSource to promote your service offering and reach more customers together with [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]. 

- Leverage and join the active community around [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]. 

With your existing service offering, you path forward with [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] can be: 

1. You develop a **Connect app** in your preferred coding language, using the exposed APIs from [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]. Read more [here](readiness-connect-apps.md).
2. You develop an **Add-on app**, which enriches the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] experience. This type of app, which integrates into user experience of [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)], allows you to build an interface based on how you want your data to flow between [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] and your service offering. Read more [here](readiness-add-on-apps.md).
