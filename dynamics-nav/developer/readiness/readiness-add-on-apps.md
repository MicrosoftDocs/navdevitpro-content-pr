# Add-On Apps

## What is an Add-on app? 
An Add-on app extends the experience and the existing functionality of [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]. Add-on apps can be used in multiple scenarios, whether it is to integrate to online services, making custom web services, adding business functionality, or extending the user interface. 

Add-on apps are developed using Extensions version 2.0 and the modern development tools based on Visual Studio Code. Add-on apps can be published through Microsoft AppSource, as configurable pre-built apps that can be applied on individual customer environments in [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)].

## How do I develop an Add-on app?
<!-- To develop an Add-on app, we advise you to create a development environment for Dynamics 365 Business Central. Follow the process described in this video to set up your environment:

Add-on apps are created using the AL language in Visual Studio Code, which needs to be installed locally or on a Virtual Machine. The source code for your Add-on app is file-based, and we recommend that you set up a repository in a source code management system like GitHub. For more information on getting started with AL, see COMING SOON.

To ease the development phase of Add-on aps we have created a video series to help you each step of the way. Learn more by consuming the content in the below video series:

## How do I get my Add-on app published in Microsoft AppSource? 
To ease your journey, from the initial idea submission to the final publication, we have created a guide that you can lean on throughout the process of bringing your app to AppSource. The guide consists of two documents that outline all the steps that must be taken to get your app to go live on the platform. You need to complete the steps in the given order to pass the different validation stages and getting your app published on AppSource. Learn more here:
