# OnAfterGetCurrRecord Trigger
Executed after the current record is retrieved from the table.  

## Applies To  
 Pages  

## Remarks  
 In a page with a repeater, the trigger is only called when the current record in the repeater is updated. OnAfterGetCurrRecord is called directly after all OnAfterGetRecord triggers are called for each row in a list.  

 If there is an error in the trigger code, then the page is closed.
