# Page and Action Triggers
Page triggers allow you to use AL code to control the behavior of the system as a result of an event on the page, such as a page opening or a field changing its value. You typically use page triggers for advanced validation and logic.  

 Page triggers can be divided into three categories:  

-   General page triggers that apply to the entire page  

-   Field page triggers that apply to a field control on a page  

-   Action triggers that apply to an action on a page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you define two methods that have the same name, one defined in a page and the other in a table that is referenced by the page, you cannot invoke the method defined in the page directly. By default, a call to the method invokes the method that is defined in the table. This behavior occurs when the method is called from a source expression or a trigger.  

## General Triggers  
 The following table lists triggers that apply to the entire page.  

|Page trigger name|Executed|  
|-----------------------|--------------|  
|[OnInit Trigger](devenv-oninit-trigger.md)|When the page is loaded, but before the controls are available.|  
|[OnOpenPage Trigger](devenv-onopenpage-trigger.md)|When the page is initialized and the controls are available.|  
|[OnClosePage Trigger](devenv-onclosepage-trigger.md)|When the page about to close and after [OnQueryClosePage Trigger](devenv-onqueryclosepage-trigger.md) trigger.|  
|[OnFindRecord Trigger](devenv-onfindrecord-trigger.md)|When the page is opened and a record is retrieved from a table.|  
|[OnNextRecord Trigger](devenv-onnextrecord-Trigger.md)|When the page changes from displaying one record to another record in a table. For example, on a Customer card page, this happens when a user selects **Next** (Ctrl+Page Down) or **Previous** (Ctrl+Page Up).|  
|[OnAfterGetCurrRecord Trigger](devenv-onaftergetcurrrecord-trigger.md)|After the current record is retrieved from the table.|  
|[OnAfterGetRecord Trigger](devenv-onaftergetrecord-trigger.md)|When a record has been retrieved but not yet displayed.|  
|[OnNewRecord Trigger](devenv-onnewrecord-trigger.md)|When a new record has been initialized but not yet displayed.|  
|[OnInsertRecord Trigger](devenv-oninsertrecord-trigger.md)|When a new record is about to be inserted in the table.|  
|[OnModifyRecord Trigger](devenv-onmodifyrecord-trigger.md)|When a record is about to be modified in the table.|  
|[OnDeleteRecord Trigger](devenv-ondeleterecord-trigger.md)|When a record is about to be deleted from the table.|  
|[OnQueryClosePage Trigger](devenv-onqueryclosepage-trigger.md)|When the page is about to close, but before the [OnClosePage Trigger](devenv-onclosepage-trigger.md).|  

## Field Triggers  
 The following table describes the triggers that are available on field controls.  

|Control trigger|Executed|  
|---------------------|--------------|  
|[OnValidate (Page fields) Trigger](devenv-onvalidate-page-fields-trigger.md)|When the user changes the value in a field and then selects away from the field so that the field loses focus.|  
|[OnLookup (Page fields) Trigger](devenv-onlookup-page-fields-trigger.md)|When the user requests a lookup by clicking a field's lookup button or pressing F4.|  
|[OnDrillDown Trigger](devenv-ondrilldown-trigger.md)|When the user requests a drill-down by choosing the field's drill-down button or pressing Shift+F8.|  
|[OnAssistEdit Trigger](devenv-onassistedit-trigger.md)|When the user requests assist-edit by choosing an AssistEdit button or by pressing Shift+F4.|  

<!--NAV |[OnControlAddin Trigger](devenv-oncontroladdin-trigger.md)|When a control add-in is initiated on a page.| -->

## Action Triggers  
 The following table lists triggers that apply to actions on a page.
