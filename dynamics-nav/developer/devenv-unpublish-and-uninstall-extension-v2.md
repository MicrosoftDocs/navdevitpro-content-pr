## Unpublishing and Uninstalling Extensions
Similar to the process for making an extension available to tenant users, there are also three operations, or tasks, related to the removal of an extension: uninstalling, unpublishing, and synchronizing (in clean mode). Each operation provides a different level of removal:

|Task|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Uninstalling an extension|<ul><li>Done on the tenant level for a specific extension version.</li><li>Disables the extension on the tenant - making it unavailable to users in the client and removing any user interface that the extension provides.</li><li>Does not affect business data in the tenant, modify SQL, or run any user code. Data that has been collected through the use of the extension is preserved. As long as the extension has not been unpublished, it can be reinstalled and the data is still available.</li><li>For example, you would unistall an extension if you discovered an issue with current extension, and you do not want it available to users until a newer version is published.</li></ul> |

-   *Uninstalling* an extension is done on the tenant level for a specific extension version. Uninstalling an extension essentially disables the extension on the tenant - making it unavailable to users in the client and removing any user interface that the extension provides. Uninstalling an extension does not affect business data in the tenant, modify SQL, or run any user code. Data that has been collected through the use of the extension is preserved. So as long as the extension has not been unpublished, it can be reinstalled and the data is still available. Uninstalling an extension can be useful, for example, if you discovered an issue with current extension, and you do not want it available to users until a newer version is published.  

-   *Unpublishing* an extension is done on the [!INCLUDE[nav_server_md](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance level for a specific extension version. This deletes the extension package from the application database that is mounted on the server instance. This means that the extension is no longer available for installation on tenants of the server instance. Like uninstalling an extension, this does not affect business data in the tenant, modify SQL, or run any user code. 

    An extension **cannot** be unpublished if it is installed on a tenant of the server instance. You would unpublish an extension version when it is no longer in use by any tenant, and you want to prevent tenants from using it again. This is typically the case after an extension has been upgraded from one extension version (for example, 11.0.0.1) to newer version (11.0.0.2) on all tenants. 

-   *Synchonizing in clean mode* of an extension is done on the tenant level for all versions of an extension. It removes the database schema that is defined extension versions, which deletes all data in the extension. In other words, if a table or table extension was included in any version of the extension, then the respective full or companion table will be deleted from the tenant database, and data in the table is lost.

You cannot synchronize in clean mode if any version of the extension is installed on a tenant of the server instance.
 
In production, this should primarily be done as a final cleanup step after all versions of an extension have been uninstalled and unpublished for good. During extension development, this can be useful in order to give the developer a "clean" environment when creating database schema related modifications (table extensions, tables).

## Uninstalling extensions
You can uninstall an extension by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] or from the client. 

### To uninstall an extension by using [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](includes/nav_shell_md.md)] 

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](includes/nav_shell_md.md)]. 

    For more information, see [Starting a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell Session](../Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-PowerShell-Cmdlets.md#StartAdminShell). 
2. To get a list of the extensions that are currently installed on a tenant, run the [Get-NAVAppInfo cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/get-navappinfo) with the `Tenant` parameter set.

    This cmdlet is useful because when you uninstall the extension, you will have to provide information about the extension, such as the its name, version, or path to the extension package file.

    ```
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Tenant TenantID
    ```

    Replace `TenantID` with the tenant ID of the database. If you do not have a multitenant server instance, use `default` or omit this parameter. 

3. To uninstall an extension, run the [Uninstall-NAVApp cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/uninstall-navapp).

    The following example uninstalls an extension by using its extension package file path `.\MyExtension.app`. 

    ```  
    Uninstall-NAVApp -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Path '.\MyExtension.app'  
    ``` 

    The following example uninstalls an extension by using its name `My Extension` and version (in this case `1.0.0.0`):

    ```  
    Uninstall-NAVApp -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Name "My Extension" -Version 1.0.0.0
    ```  

    The following example combines the Get-NAVAppInfo and Unpublish-NAVApp cmldets into a single command:

    ```  
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Name 'My Extension' -Version 1.0.0.0 | Uninstall-NAVApp
    ```  

### To uninstall an extension by using the client  

1.  In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], use search to open the **Extension Management** page.

    In the **Extension Management** window, you can view the extensions that are installed on the tenant 
2.  Choose an extension, and choose the **Uninstall** action.


## Unpublishing extensions
You unpublish an extension on a [!INCLUDE[nav_server_md](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](includes/nav_shell_md.md)].


1.  Start the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](includes/nav_shell_md.md)]. 

    For more information, see [Starting a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell Session](../Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-PowerShell-Cmdlets.md#StartAdminShell). 

2. To get a list of the extensions that are currently published on a tenant, run the [Get-NAVAppInfo cmdlet] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/get-navappinfo) without the `Tenant` parameter.
    
    This is useful because a server instance can have several published extensions, and unpublishing an extension requires that you provide specific information about the extension, like the name, version or path to extension package file. 

    ```
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer
    ```

3. To unpublish the extension, run the [Unpublish-NAVApp cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/unpublish-navapp). You can unpublish the extension by specifying the path to extension package file or by the extension name and version.

    The following example unpublishes an extension by using its extension package file path `.\MyExtension.app`. 

    ```  
    Unpublish-NAVApp -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Path '.\MyExtension.app'  
    ``` 
    
    The following example unpublishes an extension by using its name `My Extension` and version (in this case `1.0.0.0`):

    ```  
    Unpublish-NAVApp -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Name "My Extension" -Version 1.0.0.0
    ```  

    The following example combines the Get-NAVAppInfo and Unpublish-NAVApp cmldets into a single command:

    ```  
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Name 'My Extension' -Version 1.0.0.0 | Unpublish-NAVApp
    ```


## Synchronizing (clean mode) an extension after uninstallation

1.  Start the [!INCLUDE[nav_shell_md](includes/nav_shell_md.md)]. 

    For more information, see [Starting a Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell Session](../Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-PowerShell-Cmdlets.md#StartAdminShell). 
2. Run the [Sync-NAVAPP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp) cmdlet with the `-Mode`parameter set to `Clean`.

    ```
    Sync-NAVApp -ServerInstance YourDynamicsNAVServer -Tenant 'TenantID' -Name 'My Extension' -Mode Clean
    ```
