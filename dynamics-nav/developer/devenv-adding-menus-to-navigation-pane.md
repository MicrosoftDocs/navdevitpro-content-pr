# Adding Menus to the Navigation Pane
The Navigation Pane appears on the left side of the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] window, and contains multiple sections that enable users to quickly navigate and perform actions in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. A single section in the Navigation Pane can be defined as a menu group that contains multiple sub-menu items. 

The Navigation Pane displays the Home menu items by default; the other menu items can be accessed by clicking on the small drop-down arrow placed next to the *selected* menu category in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. For users, the menu groups that display in the Navigation Pane could change depending on the Role Center page that they access. 

## Example
The example below explains how to add the menu group called `My New Action Group` to the Navigation Pane. The sub-menu items for the `My Customers` contains the actions which are named as `Customer Bank Account List` and `Customer Ledger Entries`, each opening the equivalent page object. In this example, the `My Customers` will appear on the Navigation Pane for the **Sales Order Processor** Role Center. 

```al
pageextension 50120 ExtendNavigationPane extends "Order Processor Role Center"
{

    actions
    {
        addlast(Sections)
        {
            group("My Customers")
            {
                action("Customer Bank Account List")
                {
                    RunObject = page "Customer Bank Account List";
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }
                 action("Customer Ledger Entries")
                {
                    RunObject = page "Customer Ledger Entries";
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can also enable pages and reports to appear in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] search for a quick navigational support. For more information, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](devenv-al-menusuite-functionality.md).
