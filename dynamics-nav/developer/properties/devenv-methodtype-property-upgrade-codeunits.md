# FunctionType Property (Upgrade Codeunits)
Sets the type of method in an upgrade codeunit.  

## Applies To  
 AL methods on upgrade codeunits. An upgrade codeunit is codeunit that has the [SubType Property (Codeunit)](devenv-subtype-property-codeunit.md) set to **Upgrade**.  

## Property Value  

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Normal**|Acts as normal method.|  
|**UpgradePerCompany**|Provides instructions for upgrading data in a business data table.<br /><br /> When you perform a data upgrade, these methods are run for all companies in the database, where each method is executed within its own system session on [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server_md](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)] that connects to the specific company. You typically use this type of method when the data in the table that you upgrading is company-specific, as specified by the table's [DataPerCompany Property](devenv-datapercompany-property.md). <!--For more information, see [Upgrade Codeunits](Upgrade-Codeunits.md#upgradedunctions).-->|  
|**UpgradePerDatabase**|Provides instructions for upgrading data in a business data table.<br /><br /> These methods are executed once during an upgrade process, in a single system session on [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server_md](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)] that does not open any company. You typically use an **UpgradePerDatabase** method when the data in the table that you are upgrading is not company-specific. This can prevent locking issues when upgrade methods are run in parallel mode. <!-- For more information, see [Upgrade Codeunits](Upgrade-Codeunits.md#upgradedunctions).-->|  
|**TableSyncSetup**|Provides instructions about how to synchronize the table schemas in the business database with the table definitions.|  
|**CheckPrecondition**|Provides logic that checks conditions that must be met in order for the data upgrade process to continue and start running the **Upgrade** methods.|
