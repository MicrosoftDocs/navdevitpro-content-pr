# PromotedActionCategoriesML Property
Sets the caption of the group that you are promoting the action to.  
  
## Applies To  
  
-   Page actions  
  
## Remarks  
 Promoted actions appear in the ribbon on a page. You promote an action by setting the [Promoted Property](devenv-promoted-property.md). Categories allow you to group similar actions under a common caption. You can choose between 10 categories: New, Process, Report, and Category4 through Category10. By default, the category names are used as the captions in the ribbon. 
 <!-- For information about changing the captions, see [How to: Define Promoted Action Categories Captions for the Ribbon](How-to--Define-Promoted-Action-Categories-Captions-for-the-Ribbon.md).  -->
