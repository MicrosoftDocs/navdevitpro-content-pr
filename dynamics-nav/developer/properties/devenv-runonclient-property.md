# RunOnClient Property
Sets whether a .NET object that is defined by a variable is run on the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_server](../includes/nav_server_md.md)].  

## Applies To  
 Variables of the **DotNet** data type.  

## Property Values  
 **True** if you want to run the .NET object on the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]; otherwise, **false**. The default is **false**.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../includes/nav_web_md.md)] does not support running the .NET object on the client.  

## Remarks  
 The RunOnClient property is part of .NET interoperability in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] that you can use to expand your solution using .NET assemblies. With .NET interoperability, you can call methods and properties in a class of a .NET assembly from AL code by defining a variable for the class. When you set the RunOnClient property to **true**, then the class instance that is defined by the variable is instantiated on the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you set the RunOnClient property to **true**, then the .NET assembly that is used by the variable must be installed on the machine that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)].
