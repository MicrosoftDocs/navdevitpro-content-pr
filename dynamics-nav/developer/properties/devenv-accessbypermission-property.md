# AccessByPermission Property
Sets a value for a table field or UI element that determines the permission mask for an object that a user must have to see and access the related page fields or UI element in the client. The UI element will be removed at runtime if the user does not have permissions to a certain object as specified in the **AccessByPermission** property.

 All types of UI elements will be removed if they relate to an object to which the user does not have the required permissions:  

-   Fields on pages, including FactBoxes  

-   Actions on pages, including toolbars and navigation panes  

-   Page parts, such as **Lines** FastTabs  

## Applies To  

-   Fields in tables (affecting all related fields on pages)  

-   Fields on pages  

-   Actions on pages  

-   MenuSuite items  

-   Page parts, such as a **Lines** FastTab  

<!--
> [!NOTE]  
>  To use this property, the **UI Elements Removal** field in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] must be set to **LicenseFile** or **LicenseFileAndUserPermissions**. For more information, see [How to: Specify When UI Elements Are Removed](How-to--Specify-When-UI-Elements-Are-Removed.md).  

When you choose the **AssistEdit** button, the **Access By Permission** window opens. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  
-->

## Property Values  

The **AccessByPermission** property values are as described below: 

| Values   |Represents  |Description   |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|R         |Read        |Specify if Read permission is required to display the UI element.|
|I         |Insert      |Specify if Insert permission is required to display the UI element.| 
|M         |Modify      |Specify if Modify permission is required to display the UI element.
|D         |Delete      |Specify if Delete permission is required to display the UI element.|
|X         |Execute     |Specify if Execute permission is required to display the UI element.|

## Remarks

The property value for TableData can be set with a combination of **Read**, **Insert**, **Modify** and **Delete** permissions. This means, you can set the property value to ``RIMD`` permissions; the value ``X`` is not valid for TableData. 

For other objects including Table, Page, Query, Report, Codeunit, or Xmlport, it can only be **Execute** permission. This means, you can set the property value to ``X`` for the specified object type. 

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you set multiple permissions, then one or the other applies. 

## Syntax
```
AccessByPermission = tabledata MySetup = I; 
```

## Dependent Property

The **UsageCategory** property is a required setting used together with the **AccessByPermission** property. This enables a page or a report to be available in Search for the navigation support. For more information about navigation support, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](../devenv-al-menusuite-functionality.md).
