# ApplicationArea Property
Sets the application areas that apply to the control.  
  
## Applies to  
  
-   Page field, part, and action controls 
  
-   Report request page field controls  
  
-   MenuSuite items  
  
## Property Values  
 A text string that contains a comma-separated list of application area tags.  
  
 An application area tag must have the format #*name*, where *name* is the application area. The *name* can be any combination of letters (Aa-Zz) and numbers (0-9) without spaces. For example, to specify the **Basic** and **Fixed Assets** application areas, set the property to **#Basic,#FixedAssets**.  
  
 If the control applies to all application areas, you can set the property to **All**. This means that the control will always appear in the user interface.  
 
## Syntax
```
ApplicationArea = All;
```

## Remarks  
 The **ApplicationArea** property is used together with the [APPLICATIONAREA method](../methods/devenv-applicationarea-method.md) to hide user interface elements.  
  
 If one or more application areas are enabled in a session, any controls that are not tagged with an application area will not appear in the user interface.  

## Dependent Property

The **UsageCategory** property is a required setting used together with the **ApplicationArea** property. This enables a page or a report to be avaiable in Search for the navigation support. For more information about navigation support, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](../devenv-al-menusuite-functionality.md).
