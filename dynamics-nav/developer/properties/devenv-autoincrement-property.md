# AutoIncrement Property
Sets whether the field value should be automatically incremented.  
  
## Applies To  
 Fields of [Integer Data Type](../datatypes/devenv-integer-data-type.md) and [BigInteger Data Type](../datatypes/devenv-biginteger-data-type.md)  
  
## Property Value  
 **True** if the field value is automatically incremented; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **true**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to manually assign a value to a field that has the AutoIncrement property set to **true**, you must be member of the SQL Server db_owner database permission set.  
  
## Remarks  
 A table can only contain one auto-increment field. The numbers assigned to this field will not always be consecutive for the following reasons:  
  
-   If you delete some records from a table, the numbers used for these records are not reused.  
  
-   If several transactions are performed at the same time, they will each be assigned a different number. However, if one of these transactions is rolled back, the number that it was assigned is not reused.  
  
 If you add an auto-increment field to an existing table, the field automatically generates consecutive values and inserts them into the table. If you enable the AutoIncrement property for a field that already contains data, there must be no zero values in the field.  
  
 The AutoIncrement property is designed to always assign numbers automatically. If you want to insert a record, be sure that the value in this field is blank before you insert the record.  
  
 The AutoIncrement property does not work with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] temporary tables.
