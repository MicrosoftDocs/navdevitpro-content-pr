# TableType Property
Specifies the table type.  

## Applies To  

-   Tables  

## Property Value  

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**Normal**|Specifies the table as a normal table in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] database. This is the default value.|  
|**CRM**|Specifies the table as an integration table for integrating [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm](../includes/crm_md.md)]. The table is typically based on an entity in [!INCLUDE[crm](../includes/crm_md.md)], such as the Accounts entity.|  
|**ExternalSQL**|Specifies the table as a table or view in SQL Server that is not in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] database.|  
|**Exchange**|This is for internal use only.|
|**MicrosoftGraph**|This is for internal use only.|

## Remarks  
 Tables that are marked as **CRM** or **ExternalSQL** are considered to external tables that are not managed by [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. These tables use a different SQL Server connection than the normal tables in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] database. <!-- For more information, see [External Tables](External-Tables.md).  -->

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  We advise against creating tables of type CRM manually. Instead, use the integration mapping functionality.
