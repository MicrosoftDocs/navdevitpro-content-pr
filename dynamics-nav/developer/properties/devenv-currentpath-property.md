# CurrentPath Property
Returns the path of the current node as a text string.  
  
## Applies To  
  
-   XMLports  
  
## Remarks  
 You set the **CurrentPath** property in AL code on a method or trigger. For example, you can write code such as the following:  
  
 `currXMLport.CURRENTPATH`  
  
 Each node in the path is separated by a ‘`/`’, for example, `/Root/Vendors/Vendor/Name`.  
  
 For an example of how to use this property, see XMLPort 1232, **Exp. Bank Data Conv. Serv.-CT**, in the [!INCLUDE[demolong](../includes/demolong_md.md)] and refer to the `LOCAL GetValue(PostExchNo : Integer;LineNo : Integer) : Text` method.
