# FAQ for Developing in AL
This topic contains a number of frequently asked questions and answers to these questions. 

## How do I get started?
For an overview of developing apps for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], see [aka.ms/GetStartedWithApps](devenv-develop-apps-for-fin.md)

Next, follow the [Getting Started with AL](devenv-get-started.md) to set up the tools.


## Which version of the AL Language extension should I use?
1) For [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] you must use the AL Language extension that is installed together with the product (minimum version 0.12.XXX).
2) For [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] cloud sandboxes you must use the AL Language extension available in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).
3) For the latest Developer Preview releases you must use the AL Language extension that is available on the Docker images.

## How do I enable the debugger?
To read about enabling the Visual Studio Code Debugger, see here [Debugging](devenv-debugging.md)

## Can I create something similar to Menusuites?
In the AL Language extension, the concept of Menusuites is not supported. The two primary purposes of Menusuites are:

- Making pages searchable
- Making pages accessible through a navigation structure

The first purpose can be achieved in Extensions V2 by using the new properties added to Pages and Reports. For more information, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](devenv-al-menusuite-functionality.md).

The second purpose can be achieved by extending the Navigation Pane page and/or by adding Actions to other existing pages that can serve as a navigation starting point. For more information, see [Adding Menus to the Navigation Pane](devenv-adding-menus-to-navigation-pane.md).

## How do I upgrade Extensions V1 to Extensions V2?
For information on upgrading, see the following topics:
[Upgrading Extensions v2](devenv-upgrading-extensions.md) and [Converting from Extensions v1 to Extensions v2](devenv-upgrade-v1-to-v2-overview.md).

## File APIs are not available in Extensions V2. What do I do?
Code that relies on temporary files must be rewritten to rely on `InStream` and `OutStream` types. Code that relies on permanent files must be rewritten to use another form of permanent storage.

## DotNet types are not available in Extensions V2. What now?
For cloud solutions DotNet interop is not available due to safety issues in running arbitrary .NET code on cloud servers. 

With the AL Language extension, you can find AL types that replace the most typical usages of .NET like HTTP, JSON, XML, StringBuilder, Dictionaries and Lists. Many .NET usages can be replaced directly by the AL types resulting in much cleaner code. For more information, see [HTTP, JSON, TextBuilder, and XML API Overview](devenv-restapi-overview.md).

For things that are not possible to achieve in AL code, the recommendation is to use Azure Functions to host the DLL or C# code previously embedded and call that service from AL.
