# Developing Connect Apps for Dynamics 365 for Financials
Reach more customers by bringing apps for Dynamics 365 for Financials into Microsoft Appsource, the marketplace for Microsoft business apps. 
Dynamics 365 gives you rich functionality, a modern always up-to-date platform, and a set of great new development tools.
When your app is done, publish it through Microsoft AppSource – the marketplace for Microsoft’s business apps and start benefiting from a brand that millions of users know and trust.

A **Connect app** establishes a connection between two independent services using an API to interchange data. A typical example of a Connect app is a Payroll solution. All work related to Payroll is done within your service and only as a last step is the financial data posted into Dynamics 365 for Financials using the API. A Connect app is mainly created using common development tools, REST API’s, and the API’s made available in Dynamics 365 for Financials from Update 7 and onwards. When needed a Connect app in Dynamics 365 for Financials can have a single page or two created as an extension used for setup, configuration or to support for example an import scenario.
