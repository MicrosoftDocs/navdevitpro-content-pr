# Dictionary Data Type
 Dictionary data type represents a collection of keys and values. The Dictionary provides a mapping of the set of keys with their values.

## Remarks  
 Each addition to the dictionary consists of a value, and its associated key. Every key in a Dictionary must be unique. A key cannot be null, but a value can be, only when the value type is a reference type.

## Example  
In the following example, the variable ``counter`` represents the Dictionary data type to store a value representing the number of occurrences for each character in the ``customerName``. Using the ``Get`` method, you get the number of occurences for the character at position ``i``. If ``i`` returns **false**, it means there is no value associated with that character, so you add the value 1. If ``i`` returns **true**, it means the value already exists, so you add ``c + 1`` to the value. The ``Add`` method adds the {key:value} pair to the Dictionary.

```
procedure CountCharactersInCustomerName(customerName: Text; var counter: Dictionary of [Char, Integer]);
var
    i : Integer;
    c : Integer;
begin

    for i := 1 to StrLen(customerName) do 
    begin
        if counter.Get(customerName[i], c) then
            counter.Set(customerName[i], c + 1) 
        else 
            counter.Add(customerName[i], 1);
    end;
end;

```
