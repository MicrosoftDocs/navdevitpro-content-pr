# Automation Data Type
Use the Automation data type to reference an automation server.  

### To use an automation server in Dynamics 365 for Financials

1. Define a variable of type Automation and give it a name.  

2. Select the **Subtype** field, and in the **Automation Object List** window that opens, in the **Automation Server** field, get a list of available automation servers.  

3. Select a server and then choose the **OK** button.  

    In the **Automation Object List** the interfaces of the selected automation server are displayed.  

4. Select an interface and then choose the **OK** button.  

   This procedure has selected the GUID of the automation server, the version number, and the GUID of the interface. It is immediately evaluated into a name such as *\<name of server>*.*\<name of interface>*, as in the following:  

```  
'Microsoft Excel X.0 Object Library'.Application  
```  

When you have defined an automation server as a variable, you must use CREATE method (Automation) <!--(../../../articles/devenv-methods-not-supported/devenv-create-method-automation.md) --> to create an instance of the server. After that, you can use the server through the variable. You can browse its methods and properties in the **Symbol** menu.  

When you are using a server, you should know that there is not a one-to-one relationship between AL data types and COM data types. 
<!-- For an overview of the data type mapping, see [Using COM Technologies in Microsoft Dynamics NAV](../../../dynamics-nav/Using-COM-Technologies-in-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV.md).  -->

If you use a variable of type Automation to automate Microsoft Excel and you run an English \(United States\) version of Excel but the regional settings for the computer are configured for a non-English language, then you will receive the following error:  

```  
Error: 0x80028018 (-2147647512)  
Description: Old Format or Invalid Type Library   
```  

For more information, see Microsoft Help and Support article [320369: BUG: "Old format or invalid type library" error when automating Excel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=3052&kbid=320369).  

<!--
