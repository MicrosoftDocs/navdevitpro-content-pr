# AL Methods
Like other languages, AL methods are a fundamental programming element. A method, also known as a procedure, is a named group of statements that perform an operation or task. Depending on the scope, methods can be executed, or *called*, from the same object in which they are declared or from other parts of the application. 

There are two types of methods: system methods and user-defined (custom) methods.

- Built-in methods are part of the platform. Built-in methods can be used for different purposes, such as string handling, text formatting, database handling, and so on. For information about the available built-in methods, see [AL Method Reference](methods/devenv-al-method-reference.md) and [Essential AL Methods](devenv-essential-al-methods.md).

- Custom methods are specialized methods for your application to bind the objects, such as tables, pages, and codeunits, together to form a unified whole. You can create special methods for use anywhere in the database.

## Declaring methods

The method declaration defines the method and has the following syntax:

```
[Attributes(arguments list)]
local procedure <method_name>(parameter list) <return_value_name> : <data_type>[<length>]
```

### Snippet support
Typing the shortcut ```tprocedure``` will create the basic structure for a method when using the AL Extension in Visual Studio Code.

### Attributes (optional)
An attribute is modifier on a method declaration that specifies information that controls the method's use and behavior. For example, decorating a method with the Integration attribute sets the method to be an event publisher. An attribute can have one or more arguments that set properties for the method instance.

Attributes are placed before the method. For information about the available attributes, see [Method Attributes](methods/devenv-method-attributes.md).

### Local and global scope
A method can be a *local* method or *global* method. A local method can only be accessed or called from inside the object in which it is declared. A global method can be called from inside the object in which it is declared and from other objects.

To declare a local method, start the declaration with `local`: 
```
local procedure MyMethod();
```
To declare a global method, omit `local`:

```
 procedure MyMethod();
```

### Parameters (optional)  
A parameter is one or more variables or expressions that are sent to the method through
the method call. The parameter provides information to the method, and the
method can modify that information. In the method declaration, you place the parameters in parentheses `()`. If there is more than one parameter, the parameters are
separated by commas. A parameter is defined by a data type. Some data types, such as `Record`, require an additional subtype.

For example, the the following method declaration includes two parameters: `MyCustomer`and `MyDimension`:
```
 procedure  MyMethod(MyCustomer : Record Customer;VAR MyDimension : ARRAY [2] OF Boolean)
```

### Return values (optional)

A method can return data that can be then coded against. A return value is a defined by a name, data type, and optional length depending on the data type (For example, if the return value is a Text DataType, the text might have a length of 50).

## <a name="CallMethod"></a>Calling methods
You can execute, or call, a built-in or custom method by using its name in a method call statement. When a method is called the current application sequence is suspended and the code on the method is executed. When the method code is completed, the application code sequence returns to where the method was called from. How the method is called determines what happens when it returns.

A method can be used as part of an expression. For example, the following code uses a
method named `CalculatePrice` as an expression:
```
TotalCost := Quantity * CalculatePrice;
```
In this case, the `CalculatePrice` method must return a value that is used in evaluating the
expression. This return value is then multiplied by the Quantity variable and that
result is assigned to the TotalCost variable.

A method can also be run by using a method call statement. This statement
only calls the method and does not return any value. The following is an
example of calling a method named `MyRunMethod`:
```
IF Quantity > 5 THEN
MyRunMethod;
```
The `MyRunMethod` returns no data back to the calling code.

### <a name="Parameters"></a> parameters  
In a method call, the parameters are separated by commas, and the optional parameters may be omitted starting from the right. For example, this means that if a method has three optional parameters, then you cannot omit the second parameter without omitting the third parameter.  
  
You can specify that a parameter is passed to a method by value or by reference.  
  
-   If a parameter is passed by value, then a copy of the variable is passed to the method. Any changes that the method makes to the value of the variable are local changes that affect only the copy, not the variable itself.  
  
-   If a parameter is passed by reference, then a reference to the variable is passed to the method. The method can change the value of the variable itself.  
  
<!--NAV For more information about how to specify that a parameter is passed by value or by reference, see [How to: Add a Method to a Codeunit](How-to--Add-a-Method-to-a-Codeunit.md).-->  
  
## Example 1  
 The following shows the syntax for a method.  
  
```  
METHOD([Optional1] [, Optional2] [, Optional3])  
```  
  
 The method that uses the syntax above can be called by using the following code.  
  
```  
METHOD(Optional1, Optional2)  
```  
  
 This method cannot be called by using the following code.  
  
```  
FUNCTION(, Optional2, Optional3)  
```  
  
## Example 2  
 ABS is an example of an AL method that has a fixed number of parameters \(1\).  
  
```  
Value := -1033; //A negative integer value  
PositiveValue := ABS(Value); //Calculate the positive value 1033  
```  
  
## Example 3  
 The method DMY2DATE is an example of a method that can be called by using a variable number of parameters.  
  
```  
NewDate := DMY2DATE(5, 11, 1992); //Returns the date November 5, 1992  
```  
  
 Depending on the use of the DMY2DATE method, 1, 2, or 3 parameters can be passed to the method because the second and third parameters are optional. When the second and third parameters are not used, values from the system date are used as default.  
  
## Example 4  
 You can assign the return value of a method to a variable.  
  
```  
ReturnVal := MyMethod(Param1);  
```  
  
### Example 5  
 In this example, MyMethod returns a Boolean value. You can use the return value in a conditional statement.  
  
```  
IF (MyMethod(Param1)) THEN  
  <Statement1>  
ELSE  
  <Statement2>  
```
