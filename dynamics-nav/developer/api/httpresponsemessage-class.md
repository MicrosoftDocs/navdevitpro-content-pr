# HttpResponseMessage Class
Represents an HTTP response message.

> [!NOTE]
> For performance reasons all [HTTP, JSON, TextBuilder, and XML types](../devenv-restapi-overview.md) are *reference* types, not *value* types. Reference types holds a pointer to the data elsewhere in memory, whereas value types store its own data.

The following methods are available on the HttpResponseMessage class.

|Method name|Description|

|[Content](httpresponsemessage-content-method.md)|Gets the contents of the HTTP message.|
|[Headers](httpresponsemessage-headers-method.md)|Gets the HTTP request's HTTP headers.|
|[HttpStatusCode](httpresponsemessage-httpstatuscode-method.md)|Gets the status code of the HTTP response.|
|[IsSuccessStatusCode](httpresponsemessage-issuccessstatuscode-method.md)|Gets a value that indicates if the HTTP response was successful.|
|[SetRequestUri](httpresponsemessage-reasonphrase-method.md)|Gets the reason phrase which typically is sent by servers together with the status code.|
