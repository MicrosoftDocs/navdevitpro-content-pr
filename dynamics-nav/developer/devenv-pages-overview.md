# Pages Overview

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], pages are the main way to display and organize data. Pages are the primary object that a user will interact with and have a different behavior based on the type of page that you choose. Pages are designed independently of the device they are to be rendered on, and in this way the same page can be reused across phone, tablet, and web clients.

A page is defined in code as an object composed of controls, properties, actions, and triggers. You can also use Designer in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] to create a page. For more information, see [Using Designer](devenv-inclient-designer.md).

Whether you're creating a new page, or extending en existing page, you will add a new .al file to your project and describe the page object in code. The difference is basically that for a new page, you need to define the entire page, whereas when modifying an existing page, you only add the extra functionality or modify the existing. 

The structure of a page is hierarchical and breaks down in to three sections. The first block contains metadata for the overall page. The metadata describes the page type and the source table it is showing data from. The next section; the layout, describes the visual parts on the page. The final section details the actions that are published on the page.

Furthermore, the page has properties. Properties work in the same way for pages as they do for other [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] objects. For more information, see [Page Properties](properties/devenv-page-property-overview.md).  

## Page Metadata
For a new page object, you must at least specify the type of page; `PageType` and the data source; `SourceTable` of the page. And you can also set other metadata at the beginning of the declaration of the page object. 

```
page Id PageName
{
    PageType = List;
    SourceTable = TableName;
    Editable = true;
    ...
}
```

### Types of Pages  
Which page type you choose depends on the application task that you want to support, the content that you want to display, and how you want to display it. The Role Center page is the main or home page and it helps the user focus on the most important daily tasks and activities. Other types of pages, such as list pages or card pages are typically linked from the home page for easy access. The following page types are available:  

|Page type   |Description|
|------------|-----------|
|`RoleCenter`|The Role Center page is the main page.|
|`Card`|A Card page is used to view and edit one record or entity from a table.|
|`CardPart`|A Card Part page is used in a FactBox on another page to view or edit additional fields associated with a selected entity in the page.|
|`List`|A List page displays content from a table in a list format.|
|`ListPart`|Similar to a List page, a List Part page displays content from a table in a list format. The difference is that you use the List part page as another page in a FactBox or as a part of the Role Center page.|
|`ListPlus`|Similar to a List page, a List Plus page displays content from a table in a list format. The difference is that the List Plus page type can contain two lists in one page, and can be used as a two-dimensional matrix.|
|`Document`|A Document page usually consists of two separate pages combined into one, with one page nested in the other. A Document page is suitable for use when you want to display data from two tables that are linked together.|
|`WorkSheet`|You use a Worksheet page type for creating worksheet or journal task pages.|
|`ConfirmationDialog`|You use the ConfirmationDialog page to display messages or prompt users with a confirmation before they continue with the task that they are working on.|
|`StandardDialog`|The StandardDialog is a simple page type that you use when users only need to input data and do not need to perform other actions from the page.|
|`NavigatePage`|You use a Navigate page type to create a wizard that leads the user through a sequence of steps for completing a task.|

> [!NOTE]
> For backwards compatibility we continue to support adding non-part pages as parts. We do, however, recommend that you redesign your page to only use Card part or List part, as we may remove support in a future update. 

## Page Layout
The page layout of the page object determines what the page will look like and is specified in the `layout` section. The `layout` contains one or more `area` sections that define a certain placement on the page. 

You can choose between the following `area` categories:

|Area type|Placement on the page|
|---------|-----------------|
|`Content`|The content area displays the content of a RoleCenter or List page.|
|`FactBoxes`|The factbox area is placed to the right-most side of a page. Displays content related to an item om the main content page.|
|`RoleCenter`|The RoleCenter is the main page of the application and is used for quick access to frequently used information and tasks.|

### Adding and moving
In the `layout` section, you can use the following methods to place and move fields and groups on the page. Similarly, in the `actions` section, which is described [below](#page-actions), you use these methods to place actions in the ribbon. 

|Method example         |Applies to |
|-----------------------|-------------|
|```addfirst(General)```|Groups only|
|```addlast(General)``` |Groups only|
|```addafter(AddressDetails)``` |Fields and groups|
|```addbefore(AddressDetails)```|Fields and groups|
|```movefirst(General)```|Groups only|
|```movelast(General)``` |Groups only|
|```moveafter(AddressDetails)``` |Fields and groups|
|```movebefore(AddressDetails)```|Fields and groups|

If you want to modify existing fields and groups on a page, you use the `modify` method. See the code example below for syntax.

<!--
### Page controls  
You can add page controls to a page depending on the page type you have chosen.

|Page Control|Supported on Pages|
|------------|------------|
|`repeater`|List, Card|
|`cuegroup`||
|`part`||
|`factbox`||
|`fasttab`||
|`homepart`||
|`chartpart`||
|`pagepart`||
|`systempart`||
|`ribbon`||
|`filterpane`||
-->

  
## Page actions
All pages contain menu items and navigation controls called actions. The ```actions``` section of the page describes what the user is able to do on a page and must be designed with the user's need for process support in mind. Actions are added to the ribbon or as activity buttons/cues. The following example creates a new group in the ribbon and places it last in the General group.

```
addlast(General)
        {
            group(MyActionGroup)
            {
                Action(MyAction1)
                {
                    CaptionML = ENU='Hello!';

                    trigger OnAction();
                    begin
                        Message('My message');
                    end;
                }
             }
         }   
        ...
```

## Best practices for designing pages  
We recommend that you simplify the user experience by reducing what users see by default. You can promote the information that the users most frequently need to see and hide the less important information. For example:  
  
-   Place common tasks in the ribbon  
  
-   Organize information pages under FastTabs and, by default, hide the FastTabs that are infrequently visited.  
  
-   Use one to three FactBoxes on a page to provide supplementary information and a place for adding notes.
