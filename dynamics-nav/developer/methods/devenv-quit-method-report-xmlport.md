# QUIT Method (Report, XMLport)
Aborts the processing of a report or XMLport.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
QUIT  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 When you use the QUIT method, the report or XMLport is exited without committing any changes that were made to the database during the execution. The [OnPostReport Trigger](../triggers/devenv-OnPostReport-Trigger.md) or [OnPostXMLport Trigger](../triggers/devenv-OnPostXMLport-Trigger.md) trigger will not be called.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to use the QUIT method to abort an execution without committing any changes that were made during the processing.  
  
```  
  
// Do some database processing.  
CurrReport.QUIT;  
  
```
