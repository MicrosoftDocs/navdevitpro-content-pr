# IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY Method
Points to a password protected file that contains the key on the current server.  

 When encrypting or decrypting data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], an encryption key is used. A single key is used per tenant, and every tenant will have a different key. Keys can be created or imported if one exists already, as may be the case if upgrading or migrating a system from one set of hardware to another. The **IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY** method allows an administrator to specify a file \(password protected\) which contains a key and imports it to the current [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)].  

<!--
> [!NOTE]  
>  In systems with multiple [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)] instances, you must run the **IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY** method for each instance.  
-->

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Use the System Restore permission set in client to allow importing the encryption key.  

## Syntax  

```  
IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY(filename, pwd)  
```  

#### Parameters  
 *filename*  
 Value: String  

 The file that contains the encryption key.  

 *pwd*  
 Value: String  

 The password that protects the file.  

## Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  

 **true** if the encryption key was imported; otherwise, **false**.  

 If you omit this optional return value and the encryption key cannot be imported successfully, then a run-time error occurs. If you include the return value, then you must handle any errors.  

## Exceptions  
 If the import key file cannot be imported, the following error will be displayed: **Import Failed. The provided encryption key file contains invalid data and could not be imported**.  

## Example  
 This code example uses the [ENCRYPTIONENABLED](devenv-encryptionenabled-method.md) and [ENCRYPTIONKEYEXISTS](devenv-ENCRYPTIONKEYEXISTS-method.md) methods to do a check before importing the encryption key.  

 This example requires that you create a text constant ServerFileName.  

```  
IF ENCRYPTIONENABLED THEN  
        IF ENCRYPTIONKEYEXISTS THEN  
          IF NOT CONFIRM('Encryption has been enabled and the server already contains an encryption key.\'  
          + 'Importing a key will overwrite any existing key and may result in lost data.\\'  
          + 'Do you wish to continue?') THEN  
            EXIT  
        ELSE  
          IF NOT CONFIRM('Importing a key different from the already configured key will result in data corruption.\\'  
          + 'Do you wish to continue?') THEN  
            EXIT  

      IF NOT UPLOAD('Upload encrypted key','','Encrypted Key File (*.ekey)|*.ekey','ExportedKey.ekey',ServerFileName) THEN  
        EXIT;  

      IMPORTENCRYPTIONKEY(ServerFileName,'This is my personal secret');  
      ERASE(ServerFileName);  
```
