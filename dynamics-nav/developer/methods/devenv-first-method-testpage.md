# FIRST Method (TestPage)
Sets the current row of the test page as the first row in the dataset.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
OK := TestPage.FIRST  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *TestPage*  
 The test page variable that you use to refer to the test page.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  
  
 **true** if a record exists in the dataset and the current row was successfully set to the first row in the dataset; otherwise, **false**.  
  
## Remarks  
 If *TestPage* is closed or has never been opened, then the method call fails.  
  
## Example  
 This example sets the current row to the first customer in the dataset. It requires that you create a TestPage variable named CustomerList with a Subtype of Customer List.  
  
```  
CustomerList.OPENVIEW;  
CustomerList.FIRST;  
MESSAGE(CustomerList.Name.Value);  
  
```
