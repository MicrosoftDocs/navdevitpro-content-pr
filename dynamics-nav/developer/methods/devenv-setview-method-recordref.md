# SETVIEW Method (RecordRef)
Sets the current sort order, key, and filters on a table.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
RecordRef.SETVIEW(String)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *RecordRef*  
 Type: RecordRef  
  
 The RecordRef that refers to the table on which you want to set the current sort order, key, and filters.  
  
 *String*  
 Type: Text or code  
  
 The string format is the same as the [SourceTableView Property](../properties/devenv-SourceTableView-Property.md) on pages.  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of the *String* parameter can be returned by the [GETVIEW Method \(RecordRef\)](devenv-GETVIEW-Method-RecordRef.md).  
  
 If the SETVIEW method is executed with an empty string, all the filters are removed and the primary key is used.  
  
 If no table is selected, the SETVIEW method fails.  
  
 This method works the same as the [SETVIEW Method \(Record\)](devenv-SETVIEW-Method-Record.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example opens the Customer \(18\) table as a RecordRef variable that is named CustomerRecRef. The SETVIEW method sets the sort key to the Name field, sort order to Ascending and sets a filter that selects records between 1000 and 2000. The [GETVIEW Method \(RecordRef\)](devenv-GETVIEW-Method-RecordRef.md) retrieves the sort order, key and filters that have been set and stores the value in the ViewString variable. The value in the ViewString variable is displayed in a message box. This example requires that you create the following global variables and text constant.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|CustomerRecRef|RecordRef|  
|ViewString|Text|  
  
|Text constant name|DataType|ENU value|  
|------------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|Text000|Text|The following is the current sort order, key, and filters that are set: %1|  
  
```  
  
CustomerRecRef.OPEN(18);  
CustomerRecRef.SETVIEW('SORTING(Name) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(No.=CONST(10000..20000))');  
ViewString := CustomerRecRef.GETVIEW;  
MESSAGE(Text000, ViewString);  
  
```
