# EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY Method
Returns a password protected temporary filepath containing the encryption key.  

 When encrypting or decrypting data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], an encryption key is used. A single key is used per tenant and every tenant will have a different key. Keys can be exported to a file which may be necessary in the case of upgrading or migrating a system from one set of hardware to another. The **EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY** method allows an administrator to specify a destination file for the key and specify a password protection for the file.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Use the System Restore permission set in the client to allow importing the encryption key.  

## Syntax  

```  
TempFile EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY(pwd)  
```  

#### Parameters  
 *pwd*  
 Value: String  

 Specifies the password for the encryption key file.  

## Property Value/Return Value  
 Value: Text  

 A temporary filepath to where the key is exported.  

## Exceptions  
 If encryption is not enabled or the encryption key is not found, the following error will be displayed: **An encryption key is required to complete the request**.  

## Example  
 This code example uses the EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY method to return a password protected file that contains an encryption key. With the DOWNLOAD method the file is sent from the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)] computer to the client computer.  

 This example requires that you create the following text constants: ExportFileName and ClientFileName.  

```  
IF NOT ENCRYPTIONENABLED THEN  
        ERROR('Encryption has not been enabled.');  
      ExportFileName := EXPORTENCRYPTIONKEY('This is my personal secret');  

      ClientFileName := 'ExportedKey.ekey';  
      DOWNLOAD(ExportFileName,'Save the encrypted key file','','Encrypted Key File (*.ekey)|*.ekey',ClientFileName);  

      ERASE(ExportFileName);  
```
