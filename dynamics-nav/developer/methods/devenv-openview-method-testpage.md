# OPENVIEW Method (TestPage)
Opens a test page in view mode.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
TestPage.OPENVIEW  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *TestPage*  
 Type: TestPage  
  
 The test page variable that you use to refer to the test page.  
  
## Remarks  
 If *TestPage* is already open, then a run-time error occurs, and the outcome of the test method is FAILURE.  
  
 If the page to which *TestPage* refers is a card page, then the data that is loaded on the page is from the first row in the dataset.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create a variable named CustTestPage with a Subtype of Customer List and that the codeunit in which you write the code is a test codeunit.  
  
```  
// Opens the Customer Card on the first Customer in the dataset.  
CustTestPage.OPENVIEW;  
```
