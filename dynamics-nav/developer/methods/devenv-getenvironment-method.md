```  
var environment = Microsoft.Dynamics.NAV.GetEnvironment();  
  
var userName = environment.UserName;  
var companyName = environment.CompanyName;  
  
environment.OnBusyChanged = function()   
{  
    if (environment.Busy) {  
        // The client is now busy.  
    }  
    else {  
        // The client is not busy anymore.  
    }   
}  
  
```
