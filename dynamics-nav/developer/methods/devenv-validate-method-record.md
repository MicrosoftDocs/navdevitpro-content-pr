# VALIDATE Method (Record)
Calls the **OnValidate** trigger for the field that you specify.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Record.VALIDATE(Field [, NewValue])  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Record*  
 Type: Record  
  
 The record that contains the field that you specify.  
  
 *Field*  
 Type: Field  
  
 A field together with associated triggers.  
  
 *NewValue*  
 Type: Must be the same data type as *Field*, or a data type that is convertible.  
  
 The value to insert into *Field*.  
  
## Remarks  
 **VALIDATE** first checks any [TableRelation Property](../properties/devenv-TableRelation-Property.md) and then executes the [OnValidate \(Fields\) Trigger](../triggers/devenv-OnValidate-Fields-Trigger.md) of the field.  
  
 If you omit *NewValue*, then the method validates the current value.  
  
## Example  
 This example shows how to use the **VALIDATE** method.  
  
 When you enter an account number in a ledger, some table trigger code is executed to transfer the name of the account from the chart of accounts.  
  
 If you enter an account number in a batch job, then the code which transfers the name of the account is not automatically executed. The following code specifies that the appropriate field-level trigger code must be executed.  
  
 This example requires that you create the following variable.  
  
|Variable|Data type|Subtype|  
|--------------|---------------|-------------|  
|GeneralLedgerEntry|Record|G/L Entry|  
  
```  
GeneralLedgerEntry.VALIDATE("G/L AccountNo", '100');  
// This corresponds to:  
GeneralLedgerEntry."G/L AccountNo" := '100';  
GeneralLedgerEntry.VALIDATE("G/L AccountNo");   
```  
  
 The **VALIDATE** method is useful for centralizing processing, which makes your application easier to maintain.  
  
 For example, if the **OnValidate** trigger of the **Total Amount** field performs a calculation that uses values from three other fields as operands, then the calculation must be performed again if the contents of any one of these fields changes.  
  
 You should avoid entering the calculation formula in the **OnValidate** triggers of each field. This can create errors if the calculation formula has to be changed later and you have to update the code in all the triggers. Instead, you should enter the calculation formula in the **OnValidate** trigger of only one of the fields and call this trigger code from the **OnValidate** triggers of the other fields.
