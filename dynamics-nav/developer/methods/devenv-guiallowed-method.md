# GUIALLOWED Method
Checks whether the AL code can show any information on the screen.  

## Syntax  

```  

[Ok :=] GUIALLOWED  
```  

## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  

 If the return value is **true**, then the GUI is available.  

 If the return value is **false**, then the AL code is running on Microsoft Dynamics NAV Application Server and no GUI is available.  

## Remarks  
 User Portal Application Server accepts GUIALLOWED.  

## Example  
 This example shows how to use the GUIALLOWED method.  

 This example requires that you create the following global text constant.  

|Text constant|ENU value|  
|-------------------|---------------|  
|Text000|Code is running on a client.|  

```  
IF GUIALLOWED THEN  
Â MESSAGE(Text000);  
```  

 If the code runs on a client, which means that the user interface is available, a message box will appear with the following message.  

 **Code is running on a client**  

 If the code runs on Microsoft Dynamics NAV Application Server, then the message will not be displayed.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the [MESSAGE Method \(Dialog\)](devenv-MESSAGE-Method-Dialog.md) or the [ERROR Method \(Dialog\)](devenv-ERROR-Method-Dialog.md) is called when the code is running on Microsoft Dynamics NAV Application Server, then the message is written to the event log of the operating system.
