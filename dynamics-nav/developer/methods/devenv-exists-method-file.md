# EXISTS Method (File)
Determines whether a file exists.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
[Ok :=] EXISTS(Name)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Name*  
 Type: Text or code  
  
 The name of the file that you want to check. This includes the path. When you enter the path, consider these shortcuts:  
  
-   You can omit the drive designation if the file is located on the current drive.  
  
-   You can omit the full path if the file is located in the current directory.  
  
-   You can enter only the subdirectory name if the file is located in a subdirectory of the current directory.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  
  
 This return value shows whether the file exists.  
  
 **true** if the file exists; otherwise, **false**.  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the EXISTS method to determine whether the specified file exists. If the file exists, then the [WRITEMODE Method \(File\)](devenv-WRITEMODE-Method-File.md) allows the file to be open for writing. The [OPEN Method \(File\)](devenv-OPEN-Method-File.md) opens the file, the [WRITE Method \(File\)](devenv-WRITE-Method-File.md) writes the text “Hello World” to the file, and then the [CLOSE Method \(File\)](devenv-CLOSE-Method-File.md) method closes the file. If the file does not exist, an error message is displayed. This example requires that you create the following global variables. This example assumes that you have created the following file C:\\TestFolder\\TestFile2.txt.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|FileName|Text|  
|TestFile|File|  
  
```  
  
FileName := 'C:\TestFolder\TestFile2.txt';  
IF EXISTS(FileName) THEN BEGIN  
  TestFile.WRITEMODE(TRUE);  
  TestFile.OPEN(FileName);  
  TestFile.WRITE('Hello World');  
  TestFile.CLOSE;  
END  
ELSE  
MESSAGE('%1 does not exist.', FileName);  
```
