# RDLCLAYOUT Method
Gets the RDLC layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream.  
  
 The method has an instance call and a static call. The following code shows the syntax of the **RDLC** method. The first line of code is the syntax for an instance method call. The second line of code is the syntax for a static method call.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
[Ok :=] ReportVariable.RDLCLAYOUT(InStream)  
```  
  
```  
  
[Ok :=] REPORT.RDLCLAYOUT(Number, InStream)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *ReportVariable*  
 Type: Report  
  
 A variable that specifies the report object.  
  
 *Number*  
 Type: Integer  
  
 The ID of the report object for which you want to get the RDLC layout.  
  
 *InStream*  
 Type: ISequentialStream  
  
 The variable in which to return the RDLC layout.  
  
## Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  
  
 **true** if the RDLC layout was retrieved successfully; otherwise, **false**.  
  
## Remarks  
 Using the return value is optional. When you use the return value, if the RDLC layout cannot be retrieved at run-time, then the system returns **false** and no error recorded. When you omit the return value, if the RDLC layout cannot be retrieved at run-time, then an error occurs, which states that the layout could not be retrieved.
