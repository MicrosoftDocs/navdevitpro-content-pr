# CHANGECOMPANY Method (RecordRef)
Redirects references to table data from one company to another.  

## Syntax  

```  

[Ok :=] RecordRef.CHANGECOMPANY([CompanyName])  
```  

#### Parameters  
 *RecordRef*  
 Type: RecordRef  

 The RecordRef that refers to the record that you want to access from a table in another company.  

 *CompanyName*  
 Type: Text or code  

 The name of the company to which you want to change. If you omit this parameter, you change back to the current company.  

## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Boolean  

 **True** if the company was found; otherwise, **false**.  

 If you omit this optional return value and the company cannot be found, a run-time error occurs. If you include the return value, you must handle any errors.  

## Remarks  
 When executing this method, the user's access rights are respected. For example, a user cannot access data in *CompanyName* unless he already has the necessary access rights.  

 The **CHANGECOMPANY** method is not affected by the [RESET Method \(RecordRef\)](devenv-RESET-Method-RecordRef.md). You can deselect a company by making a new call to **CHANGECOMPANY** or by using the [CLEAR Method](devenv-CLEAR-Method.md).  

 Global filters always belong to a specific company. If you use the following code to select the company named NewCompany, any filters assigned to *RecordRef* will be transferred to *RecordRef* in the new company.  

```  
RecordRef.CHANGECOMPANY(NewCompany);  
```  

 Even if you run the **CHANGECOMPANY** method, triggers still run in the current company, not in the company that you specified in the **CHANGECOMPANY** method.  

## Example  
 This example shows how to use the **CHANGECOMPANY** method. The following code takes a RecordRef to table **18 Customer** in the current company and redirects it to the table in another company \(in this case Company B\). The last record in the Customer table of Company B is then deleted.  

 This example requires that you create the following global variables and text constant  

|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|MyRecordRef|RecordRef|  
|RecID|RecordID|  

|Text constant name|DataType|ENU value|  
|------------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|Text000|Text|Record to be deleted: %1|  

```  
MyRecordRef.OPEN(18);  
MyRecordRef.CHANGECOMPANY('Company B');  
MyRecordRef.FINDLAST;  
RecID := MyRecordRef.RECORDID;  
MESSAGE(Text000, RecID);  
MyRecordRef.DELETE;  
```
