# SEND Method (Notification)
Sends the notification to the client, where it will display in the UI.

```
[Ok := ]SEND
```
## Return Value
*Value*

Type: Code or text

**true** if the notification was sent; otherwise, **false**.

If you omit this optional return value and if the notification cannot be sent, then a run-time error occurs that states that the notification cannot be sent. If you include a return value, then it is assumed that you will handle any errors and no run-time error occurs, even though the notification is not sent.

## Remarks
The SEND method displays the content of the notification that is specified by the [MESSAGE Method](devenv-message-method-notification.md).

For more information and a detailed example, see [Notifications](../devenv-notifications-developing.md).

##  Example
The following code creates a notification and sends it to the client in the local scope.
```
MyNotification.MESSAGE := 'This is a notification';
MyNotification.SCOPE := NOTIFICATIONSCOPE::LocalScope;
MyNotification.SEND;
```
