# Table Extension Object
The table extension object allows you to add additional fields or to change some properties on a table provided by the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] service. In this way, you can add data to the same table and treat it as a single table. For example, you may wish to create a table extension for a retail winter sports store. In your solution you want to have ```ShoeSize``` as an additional field on the customer table. Adding this as an extension allows you to write code for the customer record and also include values for the ```ShoeSize```.

Along with defining other fields, the table extension is where you write trigger code for your additional fields.

When developing a solution for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], you will follow the code layout for a table extension as shown in the example below.

> [!NOTE]  
> Extension objects can have a name with a maximum length of 30 characters.      

## Snippet support
Typing the shortcut ```ttableext``` will create the basic layout for a table extension object when using the AL Extension in Visual Studio Code.

## Properties
Using a table extension allows you to overwrite some properties on fields in the base table. For a list of Table properties, see [Table and Table Extension Properties](properties/devenv-table-properties.md).

## Table extension example
This table extension object extends the Customer table object by adding a field ```ShoeSize```, with ID 70000900 and the data type ```Integer```. It also contains a procedure to check if the ```ShoeSize``` field is filled in.

```
tableextension 70000020 RetailWinterSportsStore extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(70000900;ShoeSize;Integer)
        {
            trigger OnValidate();
            begin
                if (rec.ShoeSize < 0) then
                begin
                   message('Shoe size not valid: %1', rec.ShoeSize);
                end;                    
            end;
        }
    }

    procedure HasShoeSize() : Boolean;
    begin
        exit(ShoeSize <> 0);
    end;

    trigger OnBeforeInsert();
    begin
        if not HasShoeSize then
            ShoeSize := Random(42);
    end;
}
```
