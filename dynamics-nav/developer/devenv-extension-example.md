# Building Your First Sample Extension With Extension Objects, Install Code, and Upgrade Code
This walkthrough will guide you through all the steps that you must follow to create a sample extension in AL. New objects and extension objects will be added to the base application for a simple reward feature for customers. Every section of this exercise includes code that serves for installing, customizing, or upgrading this sample extension. The final result can be published and installed on your tenants.

## About this walkthrough
This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:

- Setting up a sandbox environment.

- Downloading and installing Visual Studio Code and the AL Language extension for Visual Studio Code.

- Developing a sample extension with a table, a card page, and a list page.

- Using the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Designer to modify visual aspects of the extension. 

- Creating extension objects that can be used to modify page and table objects.

- Initializing the database during the installation of the extension.

- Upgrading and preserving data during the upgrade of the extension.

## Prerequisites
To complete this walkthrough, you will need: 

- The [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] tenant.

- Visual Studio Code.

- The AL Language extension for Visual Studio Code.

For more information on how to get started with your first extension for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], see [Getting Started](devenv-get-started.md).

## Rewards extension overview

The extension enables the ability to assign one of three reward levels to customers: GOLD, SILVER, and BRONZE. Each reward level can be assigned a discount percentage. Different types of objects available within the AL development environment will build the foundation of the user interface, allowing the user to edit the information. If you look for another option to update the layout of a page, you can use the Designer drag-and-drop interface. Additionally, this exercise contains the install code that will create the base for the reward levels. The upgrade code is run to upgrade the extension to a newer version and it will change the BRONZE level to ALUMINUM. Following all the steps of this walkthrough allows you to publish the extension on your tenant and create a possible new feature for your customers. 

## Reward table object
The following code adds a new table **50100 Reward** for storing the reward levels for customers. The table consists of three fields: **Reward ID**, **Description**, and **Discount Percentage**. For example, the **Description** field must contain a value of type text and it cannot exceed the limit of 250 characters. The second field contains three properties that are used to set the range of the discount percentage assigned to every customer. Properties can be created for every field, depending on the scope. 

>[!TIP]
> Type `ttable` followed by the Tab key. This snippet will create a basic layout for a table object.

```
table 50100 Reward
{
    fields
    {
        // The "Reward ID" field represents the unique identifier 
        // of the reward and can contain up to 30 Code characters. 
        field(1;"Reward ID";Code[30])
        {
        }

        // The "Description" field can contain a string 
        // with up to 250 characters.
        field(2;Description;Text[250])
        {
            // This property specified that 
            // this field cannot be left empty.
            NotBlank = true;
        }

        // The "Discount Percentage" field is a Decimal numeric value
        // that represents the discount that will 
        // be applied for this reward.
        field(3;"Discount Percentage";Decimal)
        {
            // The "MinValue" property sets the minimum value for the "Discount Percentage" 
            // field.
            MinValue = 0;

            // The "MaxValue" property sets the maximum value for the "Discount Percentage"
            // field.
            MaxValue = 100;
            
            // The "DecimalPlaces" property is set to 2 to display discount values with  
            // exactly 2 decimals.
            DecimalPlaces = 2;
        }
    }

    keys
    {
        // The field "Reward ID" is used as the primary key of this table.
        key(PK;"Reward ID")
        {
            // Create a clustered index from this key.
            Clustered = true;
        }
    }
}
```

For more information about table properties, see [Table Properties](properties/devenv-table-properties.md).


## Reward card page object
The following code adds a new page **50101 Reward Card** for viewing and editing the different reward levels that are stored in the new **Reward** table. Pages are the primary object that a user will interact with and have a different behavior based on the type of page that you choose. The **Reward Card** page is of type Card and it is used to view and edit one record or entity from the **Reward** table. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the snippet `tpage, Page of type card` to create the basic structure for the page object.

```
page 50101 "Reward Card"
{
    // The page will be of type "Card" and it will be displayed in the characteristic manner.
    PageType = Card;
    
    // The source table shows data from the "Reward" table.
    SourceTable = Reward;

    // The layout describes the visual parts on the page.
    layout
    {
        area(content)
        {           
            group(Reward)
            {
                field("Reward Id";"Reward ID")
                {
                    // ApplicationArea sets the application area that 
                    // applies to the page field and action controls. 
                    // Setting the property to All means that the control 
                    // will always appear in the user interface.
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }

                field(Description;Description)
                {
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }
                
                field("Discount Percentage";"Discount Percentage")
                {
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
For more information about the types of pages in AL, see [Pages Overview](devenv-pages-overview.md).

## Reward list page object
The following code adds the **50102 Reward List** page that enables users to view the contents of the **Reward** table and edit specific records by selecting them and viewing them in the **Reward Card** page. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the snippet `tpage, Page of type list` to create the basic structure for the page object. 

```
page 50102 "Reward List"
{
    // Specify that this page will be a list page.
    PageType = List;

    // The data of this page is taken from the "Reward" table.
    SourceTable = Reward;

    // The "CardPageId" is set to the Reward Card previously created.
    // This will allow users to open records from the list in the "Reward Card" page.
    CardPageId = "Reward Card";

    layout
    {
        area(content)
        {            
            repeater(Group)
            {
                field("Reward ID";"Reward ID")
                {
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }

                field(Description;Description)
                {
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }

                field("Discount Percentage";"Discount Percentage")
                {
                    ApplicationArea = All;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
After you have created the objects, update the **startupObjectId** in the launch.json file to 50102, the ID of the **Reward List** page and select the Ctrl+F5 shortcut to see the new page in the web client.  
For more information, see [JSON Files](devenv-json-files.md).

## Designer 

[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Designer works in the Web client and allows modifying the current page. It enables users to add existing table fields, move fields around, or remove fields from the page. Users can make changes to display the information they need, where they need it by using drag-and-drop components.  
To show how the Designer changes the design of a page, you begin by adding two new fields to the **Reward** table. These fields will be used later on to exemplify the Designer's properties. 

```
field(4;"Minimum Purchase";Decimal)
{
    MinValue = 0;
    DecimalPlaces = 2;
}

field(5;"Last Modified Date";Date)
{
    // The "Editable" property sets a value that indicates whether the field can be edited 
    // through the UI.
    Editable = false;
}

```
The **Last Modified Date** field requires constant changes to remain accurate. To keep it updated, triggers will be used. Triggers are predefined methods that are executed when certain actions happen. 

```
    // "OnInsert" trigger executes when a new record is inserted into the table.
    trigger OnInsert();
    begin
        SetLastModifiedDate();
    end;

    // "OnModify" trigger executes when a record in the table is modified.
    trigger OnModify();
    begin
        SetLastModifiedDate();
    end;

    // "OnDelete" trigger executes when a record in the table is deleted.
    trigger OnDelete();
    begin
    end;

    // "OnRename" trigger executes when a record in a primary key field is modified.
    trigger OnRename();
    begin
        SetLastModifiedDate();
    end;

    // On the current record, the the value of the "Last Modified Date" field to the current 
    // date.
    local procedure SetLastModifiedDate();
    begin
        Rec."Last Modified Date" := Today();
    end;
```

From this point, changes to the **Customer Card** page can be done either manually by adding the code below in Visual Studio Code or by using the Designer's functions. Both ways lead to the same results, but the Designer speeds up the process. 


```
field("Minimum Purchase";"Minimum Purchase")
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
}

field("Last Modified Date";"Last Modified Date")
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
}

``` 
Using the F6 key shortcut in Visual Studio Code launches the browser and enters the Designer.

> [!NOTE]  
> Every time you start designing, you create a new extension and the changes you make in the Designer will apply to all users.


To add the same fields and customize the **Customer Card** page, follow the next steps:
- Choose the purple box to the right of the **Last Modified Date** field and select **Remove**. 
- Navigate to the **Reward Card** page by choosing **+ new**.  
- Select **More** from the Designer bar. 
- Select **Field** from the Designer bar to show the list of available fields. 
- Drag the **Minimum Purchase** and **Last Modified Date** fields from the list onto the page in the **General group**. 
- Choose the **General** in the group caption to enable the value to be edited. Change the caption to **Info** and press **Enter**.

After making these adjustments, finish up your design by choosing **Stop Designing**, which allows you to name the extension with an option to download code, and save the extension for the tenant. If you choose not to download the code at the end, you can still pull the changes via the Ctrl+F7 shortcut from Visual Studio Code. You can also uninstall the extension by opening the **Extension Management** page.  
For more information about Designer, see [Designer](devenv-inclient-designer.md). 

## Customer table extension object

The **Customer** table, like many other tables, is part of the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] service and it cannot be modified directly by developers. To add additional fields or to change properties on this table, developers must create a new type of object, a table extension.
The following code creates a table extension for the **Customer** table and adds the `Reward ID` field. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the snippet `ttableext` to create a basic structure for the table extension object. 

```
tableextension 50103 "Customer Ext" extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100;"Reward ID";Code[30])
        {
            // Set links to the "Reward ID" from the Reward table.
            TableRelation = Reward."Reward ID";

            // Set whether to validate a table relationship.
            ValidateTableRelation = true;
           
           // "OnValidate" trigger executes when data is entered in a field.
            trigger OnValidate();
            begin    

            // If the "Reward ID" changed and the new record is blocked, an error is thrown. 
                if (Rec."Reward ID" <> xRec."Reward ID") and
                    (Rec.Blocked <> Blocked::" ") then
                begin
                    Error('Cannot update the rewards status of a blocked customer.')
                end;
            end;
        }
    }
}

```


## Customer card page extension object

A page extension object can be used to add new functionality to pages that are part of the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] service. The following page extension object extends the **Customer Card** page object by adding a field control, **Reward ID**, to the **General group** on the page. The field is added in the layout section, while in the actions section the code adds an action to open the **Reward List** page. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the shortcuts `tpageext` to create the basic structure for the page extension object.

```
pageextension 50104 "Customer Card Ext" extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {   
        // The "addlast" construct adds the field control as the last control in the General 
        // group.
        addlast(General)
        {
            field("Reward ID";"Reward ID")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
                
                // Lookup property is used to provide a lookup window for 
                // a text box. It is set to true, because a lookup for 
                // the field is needed.
                Lookup = true;
            }
        }
    }

    actions
    {
        // The "addfirst" construct will add the action as the first action
        // in the Navigation group.
        addfirst(Navigation)
        {
            action("Rewards")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;

                // "RunObject" sets the "Reward List" page as the object 
                // that will run when the action is activated.
                RunObject = page "Reward List";
            }
        }
    }
}
```

At this point, reward levels can be created and assigned to customers. To do that, update the startupObjectId value in launch.json to 21 and select the Ctrl+F5 key to open the page.

## Install code

After installing the extension, the **Reward List** page is empty. This is the result of the fact that the **Reward** table is also empty. Data can be entered manually into the **Reward** table by creating new records from the **Reward List** page. However, this task slows down the process, especially because the **Reward** table should be initialized with a standard number of reward levels when the extension is installed. To solve this, install codeunits can be used. A codeunit is an object that can be used to encapsulate a set of related functionality represented by procedures and variables. An install codeunit is a codeunit with the Subtype property set to Install. This codeunit provides a set of triggers that are executed when the extension is installed for the first time and when the same version is re-installed. 

In this example, the following install codeunit initializes the **Reward** table with three records representing the 'GOLD', 'SILVER', and 'BRONZE' reward levels. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the shortcuts `tcodeunit` and `ttrigger` to create the basic structure for the codeunit and trigger.

```
codeunit 50105 RewardsInstallCode
{
    // Set the codeunit to be an install codeunit. 
    Subtype = Install;
    
    // This trigger includes code for company-related operations. 
    trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany();
    var
        Reward : Record Reward;
    begin
        // If the "Reward" table is empty, insert the default rewards.
        if Reward.IsEmpty() then begin
            InsertDefaultRewards();
        end;
    end;

    // Insert the GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE reward levels
    procedure InsertDefaultRewards();
    begin
        InsertRewardLevel('GOLD', 'Gold Level', 20);
        InsertRewardLevel('SILVER', 'Silver Level', 10);
        InsertRewardLevel('BRONZE', 'Bronze Level', 5);
    end;

    // Create and insert a reward level in the "Reward" table.
    procedure InsertRewardLevel(ID : Code[30]; Description : Text[250]; Discount : Decimal);
    var
        Reward : Record Reward;
    begin
        Reward.Init();
        Reward."Reward ID" := ID;
        Reward.Description := Description;
        Reward."Discount Percentage" := Discount;
        Reward.Insert();
    end;

}
```
For more information about install code, see [Writing Extension Install Code](devenv-extension-install-code.md).

## Upgrade code
When you upgrade an extension to a newer version, if any modifications to the existing data are required to support the upgrade, you must write upgrade code in an upgrade codeunit. In this example, the following upgrade codeunit contains code that changes the BRONZE reward level to customer records to ALUMINUM. The upgrade codeunit will run when you run the `Upgrade-NAVApp` cmdlet. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to increase the `version` number of the extension in the app.json file.

```
codeunit 50106 RewardsUpgradeCode
{
    // An upgrade codeunit includes AL methods for synchronizing changes to a table definition 
    // in an application with the business data table in SQL Server and migrating existing 
    // data.
    Subtype = Upgrade;

    // "OnUpgradePerCompany" trigger is used to perform the actual upgrade.
    trigger OnUpgradePerCompany();
    var
        InstallCode : Codeunit InstallCode;
        Reward : Record Reward;

        // "ModuleInfo" is the current executing module. 
        Module : ModuleInfo;
    begin
        // Get information about the current module.
        NavApp.GetCurrentModuleInfo(Module);

        // If the code needs to be upgraded, the BRONZE reward level will be changed into the
        // ALUMINUM reward level.
        if Module.DataVersion.Major = 1 then begin
            Reward.Get('BRONZE');
            Reward.Rename('ALUMINUM');
            Reward.Description := 'Aluminum Level';
            Reward.Modify();
        end;
    end;
}
```
For more information about writing and running upgrade code, see [Upgrading Extension](devenv-upgrading-extensions.md).  

## Conclusion

This walkthrough demonstrated how an extension can be developed. The main AL objects and extension objects were used to store the reward levels, to view, and to edit them. The Designer was introduced as an alternative to modify visual aspects of page objects and to customize them from the web client instead of using code. Up to this point, the table and the page objects were empty, but the install codeunits were added and allowed to initialize the **Reward** table with a standard number of reward levels when the extension was installed. An upgrade code section was also included in this exercise to create a full picture of all processes involved when an extension is built. As a result, a user is enabled to assign one of the three reward levels to a customer and to change this scenario by upgrading the version of the extension.
