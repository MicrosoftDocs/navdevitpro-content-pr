# Defining a Report Dataset
You use report object in the [!INCLUDE[d365_dev_long_md](includes/d365_dev_long_md.md)] to define the data model, or dataset, of a report. The dataset determines the data that is extracted or calculated from the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] database tables that can be used in a report. For more information, see [Report Object](devenv-report-object.md).

You build the report dataset from data items and columns. A data item is a table. A column can be: 

-   A field in a table 

-   A variable

-   An expression 

-   A text constant

Typically, data items and columns correspond to fields in a table. When the report is run, each data item is iterated for all records in the underlying table. Filters are applied and the dataset is created. 
When a report is based on more than one table, you must set relations between the data items so that you can retrieve and organize the data. 

## Snippet support
Typing the shortcut ```treport``` will create the basic layout for a report object when using the AL Extension in Visual Studio Code. 

### Example
The following example adds the `Customer` table as the data item and the `CustomerName` and `CompanyName` as fields of a column to the report. For more information on creating a report, see [How to: Create a Report](devenv-howto-report-layout.md).
```
  dataset
    {
        dataitem(Customer; Customer)
        {
            column(CustomerName; CustomerName)
            {
            }
            column(CompanyName; CompanyName)
            {
            }
        }
    } 
```
