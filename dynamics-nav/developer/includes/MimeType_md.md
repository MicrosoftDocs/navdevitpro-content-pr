Specifies the media content type. MIME type is used by browsers, and is an Internet standard to describe the contents of a file. The *MimeType* value must be a two-part string that consists of a type and subtype, such as *image/jpeg* or *image/gif*. For more information, see [Supported Media Types](../devenv-working-with-media-on-records.md#SupportedMediaTypes). 

If this parameter is not specified, the function will deduct the MIME type from the file extension. For example the MIME type for a .jpg file is image/jpeg.
