# Troubleshooting: Import-NAVEncryptionKey Cmdlet: The path to Windows Communication Foundation was not found on the service tier
If the [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance is on an Azure virtual machine that is running Windows Server 2012 R2, you get the following error when you run the Import-NAVEncryptionkey cmdlet:  
  
 **Import-NAVEncryptionKey : The path to Windows Communication Foundation was not found on the service tier. It was expected to be in folder 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v3.0\\Windows Communication Foundation'.Have you installed the .NET Framework 3.0?**  
  
## Resolution  
 You must install the HTTP Activation feature on the Azure virtual machine. Perform one of the following procedures:  
  
-   Run the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Administration Shell as Administrator, and then run the following cmdlet:  
  
    ```  
    install-windowsfeature -Name NET-HTTP-Activation  
  
    ```  
  
-   Open Server Manager, and then use the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** to install HTTP Activation, which is available under the .NET Framework 3.5 feature.  
  
     For more information, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=623826).
