# How to: Insert Items in a MenuSuite
You can modify a **MenuSuite** by inserting existing items. If an item already exists in a menu, instead of recreating the item in another menu, you can just insert the existing item. For information about how to modify menu items, see [How to: Modify Menu Items in a MenuSuite](How-to--Modify-Menu-Items-in-a-MenuSuite.md).  
  
### To insert a menu item  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], choose **Tools**, and then choose **Object Designer** to open the Object Designer window.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, choose **MenuSuite**.  
  
3.  Choose the **MenuSuite** that you want to modify, and then choose **Design** to open Navigation Pane Designer.  
  
4.  In Navigation Pane Designer, choose the company you want to insert the item into.  
  
5.  Right-click the location in Navigation Pane Designer where you want to insert the item and then choose **Insert Items**.  
  
6.  In the **Insert Items** window, select **Insert** for each item that you want to insert, and then choose the **OK** button. This window lists all items that have already been created in Navigation Pane Designer.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Make sure that the **Insert** check box is selected for all the items that you want to insert.
