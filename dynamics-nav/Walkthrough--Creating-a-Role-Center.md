# Walkthrough: Creating a Role Center
In this walkthrough, you will learn how to create a new Role Center for the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)], a Role Center is a type of page on which you can place different parts. Each part is a container in which you can host other pages or predefined parts, such as an Outlook part or parts for adding tasks, notifications, or notes.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Only system parts, card parts, and list parts are supported page types for the Role Center.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  While removing cues is possible when customizing the Role Center, activity items cannot be removed.  
  
## About This Walkthrough

-   Creating a Role Center page.  
  
-   Creating a CardPart page that displays a visual representation of work queues.

## Story  
 Simon is a partner working for CRONUS International Ltd. Susan, the Order Processor at CRONUS, has contacted Simon and asked him to create her a new Role Center that will show her work queue, give her easy access to common actions like creating a new sales order, and will also display a list of current notifications.  
  
## Creating a Role Center Page  
 Simon creates a new Role Center using Page Designer. Simon knows that because Role Centers can contain several different parts, they are not tied to a specific source table. As a result, when Simon creates the Role Center page, he does not select a table in the **New Page** window.  
  
#### To create a Role Center page  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, choose **Page**, and then choose **New**. The **New Page** window opens.  
  
3.  Choose **Create blank page**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
     The new page opens in Page Designer.  
  
4.  On the first row, in the **Name** field, type **RoleCenterContainer**.   
    The **Type** column is preset to **Container** and the **Subtype** column is preset to **ContentArea**.  
  
5.  Select a blank row, and on the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
6.  In the **Properties** window, in the **PageType** property, set the **Value** field to **RoleCenter**.  
  
7.  Close the **Properties** window.  
  
8.  On the **File** menu, choose **Save**. Set **Name** to **Sales Order Proc. Role Center**, and set **ID** to **50005**. Choose the **OK** button.  
  
## Creating a Sales Order Processor Queue Page  
 Simon needs to create a page that provides a visual indicator of the work Susan has to do each day. He wants to host this page in a part on Susan's Role Center so he will need to create it before he can add it to the Role Center page that he just created. He has already created a table that contains the fields that he wants to use, so he only needs to create the page. Simon knows that to create a queue, he must use the **CardPart** page type.  
  
#### To create a Sales Order Processor Queue page  
  
1.  In Object Designer, choose **Page**, and then choose **New**.  
  
2.  In the **Table** text box, choose the up button, select table 9053, **Sales Cue**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
3.  Choose **Create blank page**, and then choose **OK**.  
  
     The new page opens in Page Designer.  
  
4.  On the first row, in the **Caption** column, type **SalesOrderContainer**.   
    The **Type** column is preset to **Container** and the **Subtype** column is preset to **ContentArea**.  
  
5.  Select a blank row, and on the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
6.  In the **PageType** property, set the **Value** field to **CardPart**.  
  
7.  Close the **Properties** window.  
  
8.  In the second row, in the **Caption** column, enter **For Release**, and then set **Type** to **Group** and **SubType** to **CueGroup**.  
  
9. Choose the next empty line, and on the **View** menu, choose **Field Menu**.  
  
     The **Field Menu** window opens, displaying the list of available fields from the **SalesCue** table \(Table 9053\).  
  
10. Select the following fields:  
  
    -   **Sales Quotes - Open**  
  
    -   **Sales Orders - Open**  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  You can select multiple fields by holding down the Ctrl key.  
  
11. Choose the **OK** button.  
  
     A message box appears with the following message: "Do you want to add the fields that are selected in the field menu?"  
  
12. Choose **Yes**.  
  
13. On the next empty line, in the **Caption** column, enter **Sales Orders Released Not Shipped**, then set **Type** to **Group** and **SubType** to **CueGroup**.  
  
14. Select the next empty line and, on the **View** menu, choose **Field Menu**.  
  
15. Select the following fields:  
  
    -   **Ready to Ship**  
  
    -   **Delayed**  
  
    -   **Partially Shipped**  
  
16. Choose **OK** and confirm the selection.  
  
17. On the next empty line, in the **Caption** column, enter **Returns**, then set **Type** to **Group** and set **SubType** to **CueGroup**. Choose the left arrow to negative indent this line one level.  
  
18. Select the next empty line and, on the **View** menu, choose **Field Menu**.  
  
19. Select the following fields:  
  
    -   **Sales Return Orders - All**  
  
    -   **Sales Credit Memos - All**  
  
20. Choose **OK** and confirm the selection.  
  
21. On the **File** menu, choose **Save**, name your new page **Sales Order Processor Queue** and set the **ID** to **50006**. Choose the **OK** button.  
  
22. In Object Designer, select the page, and then choose **Run.**  
  
     The [!INCLUDE[rtc](includes/rtc_md.md)] opens and displays the new page.  
  
## Adding Actions to the Sales Order Queue Page  
 Simon now needs to add actions to the **Sales Order Processor Queue** page. He knows that the **CardPart** page type is special in that he can include actions on individual groups within the page. These actions will then be displayed immediately adjacent to the queues on the page. He also adds code to the OnOpenPage\(\) method to ensure that the work queues update to reflect Susan's current work when the Role Center opens.

## Adding Parts to the Role Center Page  
 Simon now needs to add his new sales order queue page to Susan's new Role Center.
