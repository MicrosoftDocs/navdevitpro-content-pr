# How to: Break on the Next Statement
If the debugger is attached to a session, then you can specify that the debugger breaks before the next C\/AL statement is run in that session.  
  
 For more information about how to open the **Debugger** window, see [Activating the Debugger](../dynamics-nav/Activating-the-Debugger.md).  
  
### To specify a break on the next C\/AL statement  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Running Code** group, choose **Break**.
