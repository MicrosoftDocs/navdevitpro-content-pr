# Walkthrough: Exporting Data from Tables to XML Documents
XMLports are used to export data from a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database to XML format or import data from an XML file to [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database. Exporting data from your [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database into XML format enables seamless exchange of information between different computer systems. You only need a basic knowledge of XML to design and work with XMLports.  
  
 XMLports are called and run from codeunits or run from Object Designer. In this walkthrough, you will call the XMLport from a codeunit. You define the output stream that will export the data and location where the XML document should be saved in the codeunit.  
  
## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough shows you how to export data from a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] table into an XML document. This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  
  
-   Creating an XMLport.  
  
-   Compiling and saving the XMLport.  
  
-   Creating the codeunit that will run the XMLport.  
  
-   Running the XMLport.  
  
### Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] installed with a developer license.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)].  
  
## Story  
 Simon is a Microsoft Certified Partner working for [!INCLUDE[demoname](includes/demoname_md.md)] He has been asked to export records from the **Customer** table to an XML document. The records will include only the **No.**, **Name**, **Address**, **City**, and **Contacts** fields. The information will be shared with another colleague who works on a different computer system. Simon knows that he can use XMLports to convert the records in the table to XML format that can easily be shared with the colleague.  
  
## Creating the XMLport  
 You create the XMLport by designing it in XMLport Designer and setting the properties for the XMLport. You define the table and fields that you want to export in XMLport Designer. You then compile and save the XMLport.  
  
#### To create the XMLport  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, choose **XMLport**, and then choose **New** to open XMLport Designer.  
  
3.  Select an empty row in the designer. On the **View** menu, choose **Properties** to open the **XMLport-Properties** window.  
  
4.  In the **XMLport-Properties** window, locate the [Direction Property](Direction-Property.md), choose the drop-down arrow in the **Value** column and then set it to **Export**.  
  
5.  In the **XMLport-Properties** window, locate the [Format Property \(XMLports\)](Format-Property--XMLports-.md), verify that the **Value** column is set to **XML** and then close the **XMLport-Properties** window.  
  
6.  In **XMLport Designer**, in the first row, in the **Node Name** column, enter **Root**.  
  
7.  In the **Node Type** column, verify that **Element** is selected.  
  
8.  In the **Source Type** column, verify that **Text** is selected. This node represents the beginning of the XML document.  
  
9. In the second row, in the **Node Name** column, enter **Customer**.  
  
10. In the **Node Type** column, select **Element**.  
  
11. In the **Source Type** column, select **Table**. This node represents a customer record in the XML document.  
  
12. In the **Data Source** column, select the **Customer** table \(18\) from the **Table List** window. The data will be exported from the **Customer** table.  
  
13. Select the **Customer** row and use the right arrow button to indent the row one time to make it a subset of the **Root** element.  
  
     The next step is to select the fields that you want to export.  
  
14. In the next empty row under the **Customer** row, in the **Node Type** column, select **Element**.  
  
15. In the **Source Type** column, select **Field**.  
  
16. In the **Data Source** column, select the **No.** field from the **Field Lookup** window, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
17. In the **Node Name** column, enter a name for the field. For example, you can enter **No**. This node represents the fields in the record. You can enter any name, but because of consistency you might want to enter the name of field that you select.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The name that you enter in the **Node Name** column cannot contain spaces. White space in the name will result in a compile error.  
  
18. Select the **No.** row and use the right arrow button to indent the field one time to make it a subset of the **Customer** element.  
  
19. Repeat these steps to select additional fields that you want to export. For this walkthrough you can select the following fields.  
  
    |Node Name|Node Type|Source Type|Data Source|  
    |---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
    |No.|Element|Field|Customer::No.|  
    |Name|Element|Field|Customer::Name|  
    |Address|Element|Field|Customer::Address|  
    |City|Element|Field|Customer::City|  
    |Contact|Element|Field|Customer::Contact|  
  
20. On the **File** menu, choose **Save As**.  
  
21. In the **Save As** window, enter **50001** in the **ID** text box.  
  
22. In the **Name** text box, enter **CustomerXMLport**, verify that the **Compiled** check box is selected, and then choose the **OK** button. You will use the name of the XMLport later in the codeunit.  
  
23. Close XMLport Designer.  
  
## Creating the Codeunit to Export the Data  
 After you have created the XMLport, you create the codeunit that will run the XMLport and save the data. In this walkthrough, you will save the XML document on the client computer. To do this, you create the file in a temporary folder, and then download it to the client after the export is completed. In the codeunit, you will specify the path of the temporary file and the path where the XML document will be saved on the client.  
  
#### To create the codeunit  
  
1.  In Object Designer, select **Codeunit**, and then choose **New** to open the **C/AL Editor**.  
  
     You will declare variables that you will use in the code. You will create variables for the XML file, the output stream that exports the data, and the return value for the [EXPORT Function \(XMLport\)](EXPORT-Function--XMLport-.md). You will also create variables for the file that will be downloaded from the server and the file that will be saved on the client.  
  
2.  In the C/AL Editor, place the cursor in the OnRun function, and then, on the **View** menu, choose **C/AL Locals** to open the **C/AL Locals** window.  
  
3.  On the **Variables** tab, in the **Name** column, enter **CustXmlFile**.  
  
4.  In the **DataType** column, choose the drop-down arrow and select **File**. This variable represents the XML file.  
  
5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create the following additional variables.  
  
    |Variable name|DataType|  
    |-------------------|--------------|  
    |CustXmlFile|File|  
    |XmlStream|OutStream|  
    |IsExported|Boolean|  
    |FromFile|Text|  
    |ToFile|Text|  
  
6.  You will create the text constants that will store messages that are displayed in the message boxes.  
  
     In the **C/AL Locals** window, choose the **Text Constants** tab.  
  
7.  In the **Name** field, enter **Text000** and then in the **ConstValue** field, choose the **EditAssist** button to open the **Multilanguage Editor**.  
  
8.  In the **Multilanguage Editor**, in the **Language** field, select **ENU** from the **Windows Language List** window and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
9. In the **Value** field, enter the following text: **The Customer table export to XML is completed.**  
  
10. Create another text constant that is named **Text001** with value **The Export Failed.**  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The text constants are optional. However they enable messages to be translated into different languages.  
  
11. Close the **C/AL Locals** window.  
  
12. In the **C/AL Editor**, in the OnRun trigger, add the following code.  
  
    ```  
  
    CustXmlFile.CREATE(TEMPORARYPATH + 'Customer.xml');  
    CustXmlFile.CREATEOUTSTREAM(XmlStream);  
    IsExported := XMLPORT.EXPORT(XMLPORT::CustomerXMLport, XmlStream);  
    FromFile := CustXmlFile.NAME;  
    ToFile := 'CustomerClient.xml';  
    CustXmlFile.CLOSE;  
    IF IsExported THEN  
    BEGIN  
      DOWNLOAD(FromFile,'Download file','C:\Temp','Xml file(*.xml)|*.xml',ToFile);  
      ERASE(FromFile);  
      MESSAGE(Text000);  
    END  
    ELSE  
      MESSAGE(Text001);  
    ```  
  
     The code uses the [CREATE Function \(File\)](CREATE-Function--File-.md) to create an XML file that is named CustXmlFile in a temporary folder on the server.  The [TEMPORARYPATH Function](TEMPORARYPATH-Function.md) gets the path of the temporary folder. The [CREATEOUTSTREAM Function \(File\)](CREATEOUTSTREAM-Function--File-.md) opens a data stream to output the data from the table to the XML file. The [EXPORT Function \(XMLport\)](EXPORT-Function--XMLport-.md) uses the XMLport and the stream to export the data. If the export succeeds, the [DOWNLOAD Function \(File\)](DOWNLOAD-Function--File-.md) downloads the file from the temporary folder on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] to the client. The default path of the file on the client computer is set to ‘C:\\Temp’ but you can change it in the download dialog box. A message is displayed at the end of the export to indicate that the export is completed. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. This message is not required but it lets the user know that something actually occurred. The temporary file is deleted after the download is completed.  
  
13. Close the **C/AL Editor** and choose the **Yes** button at the prompt.  
  
14. In the **Save As** dialog box, in the **ID** text box, enter **50000**.  
  
15. In the **Name** text box, enter **ExportCode**.  
  
16. Verify that the **Compiled** check box is selected and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
## Running the XMLport  
 After the XMLport is created and the codeunit is written, you run the codeunit to export the data.  
  
#### To run the XMLport  
  
1.  In Object Designer, select the **ExportCode** codeunit \(50000\), and then choose the **Run** button. The [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] opens and the **Export File** dialog box is displayed. You can choose the **Open** button to open and view the file or choose the **SAVE** button to save it. In this walkthrough, you will save the file.  
  
2.  Choose the **SAVE** button to open the download window.  
  
3.  In the **Download file** window, choose the **SAVE** button. You can change the default name of the file and location where it will be saved.  
  
4.  After the export is complete, browse to the location where the XML document was saved and open it. Notice that all the records in the table are now in XML format. The `<Customer></Customer>` element represents a record and each record contains the fields that you selected in the XMLport Designer.  
  
     The XML file that is exported resembles the XML file in the following illustration. The XML file contains data for only the first four customers.

## Next Steps  
 You can also use XMLport to import data from an XML document to a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Inserting Data from XML Documents to Multiple Tables](Walkthrough--Inserting-Data-from-XML-Documents-to-Multiple-Tables.md).
