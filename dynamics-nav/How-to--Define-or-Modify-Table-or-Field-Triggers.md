# How to: Define or Modify Table or Field Triggers
The following procedure describes how to set up a trigger.  
  
### To define or modify a table or field trigger  
  
1.  Open Object Designer and then choose **Table**.  
  
2.  Select a table from the list and then choose **Design**.  
  
     The table opens in **Table Designer**.  
  
3.  Choose **View** and then choose **C/AL Code**.  
  
     The C/AL Editor opens.  
  
     The position or the cursor in Table Designer determines the order in which triggers are displayed in the C/AL Editors. For example, if you place the cursor on a specific field, the trigger for that field appears at the top of the C/AL Editor. Scroll through the list of triggers displayed to access other triggers.  
  
4.  Enter or modify the appropriate triggers.
