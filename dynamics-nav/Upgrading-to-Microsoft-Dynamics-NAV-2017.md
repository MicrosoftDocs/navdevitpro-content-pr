The upgrade process depends on different factors, such as the version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] that you are upgrading from, and the degree to which your solution differs from the standard version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The mains tasks range from converting the database to upgrading application code and data.

## Automating the Upgrade Process using Sample Windows PowerShell Scripts
You can use [!INCLUDE[wps_2](includes/wps_2_md.md)] scripts to help you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)]. You can use automation to upgrade a single [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database as well as multiple [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] databases that use the same application. [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] provides sample scripts that you can adapt for your deployment architecture.
