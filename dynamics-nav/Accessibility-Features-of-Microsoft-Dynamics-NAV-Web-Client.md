-   Keyboard Shortcuts

 The HTML source for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] content uses tags to help users of assistive technology to understand the structure and content of the page. For example, on list pages, the columns are defined in TH tags and the column headings are set with TITLE attribute inside the tag. Captions for elements, such as FastTabs, FactBoxes, and fields are included in heading tags \(H1, H2, H3, and H4\).  
  
##  <a name="Images"></a> Image and Links  
 A descriptive text for images is set with the ALT attribute inside the IMG tag. A descriptive text for hyperlinks is set with the title attribute inside the A tag.  
  
##  <a name="AssistiveTech"></a> Assistive Technologies  
 The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] supports various assistive technologies, such as high contrast, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some assistive technologies may not work well with certain elements on [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] content.
