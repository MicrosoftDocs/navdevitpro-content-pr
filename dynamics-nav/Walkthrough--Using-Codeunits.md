# Walkthrough: Using Codeunits
You can treat codeunits as objects. One codeunit variable can be assigned to another codeunit variable, which creates a new reference to the same codeunit instance. The codeunit variables then use the same set of internal variables.  
  
## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthough illustrates the following tasks:  
  
-   Creating one codeunit that has two functions: a **Set** function and a **Get** function. The **Set** function sets an internal variable to the value of the parameter given. The **Get** function returns the value of the internal variable.  
  
-   Creating one codeunit that has two codeunit variables that each call a function in the first codeunit and then assigns the codeunit variables to each other so that they use the same instance of the first codeunit.  
  
-   Modifying one of these codeunits to make it a single instance codeunit.  
  
### Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] installed with a developer license.  
  
-   The CRONUS International Ltd. demo data company.  
  
## Story  
 Viktor is a Microsoft Certified Partner working for [!INCLUDE[demoname](includes/demoname_md.md)]. To learn about codeunits in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], he plans to create a codeunit that includes **Set** and **Get** functions, create a codeunit that calls two instances of the Set\_Get codeunit, and finally convert the codeunit to a single instance codeunit.  
  
## Creating the First Codeunit  
 First, you must create a codeunit that includes the **Set** and **Get** functions. You must also write the code for these two functions.  
  
#### To create the first codeunit  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)].  
  
2.  In the development environment, on the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
3.  In Object Designer, choose **Codeunit** and then choose **New**.  
  
4.  On the **View** menu, choose **C/AL Globals**.  
  
5.  On the **Variables** tab, in the **Name** field, enter **InternalInt** to create a new variable. In the **DataType** field, select **Integer** from the drop-down list.  
  
6.  In the **C/AL GLobals** window, choose the **Functions** tab.  
  
7.  On the **Functions** tab, in the **Name** field, add two functions called **Set** and **Get**.  
  
8.  Select the **Set** function, in the **View** menu, choose **Properties**, and then set the **Local** property to **No**.  
  
     Setting this property makes the function accessible from the other codeunit that you will create. For more information about this property, see [Local Property](Local-Property.md).  
  
9. Select the **Set** function and then choose **Locals**.  
  
10. In the **Set -C/AL Locals** window, on the **Parameters** tab, in the **Name** field, enter **input**. In the **DataType** field, select **Integer** from the drop-down list.  
  
11. Close the **Set -C/AL Locals** window.  
  
12. In the **C/AL GLobals** window, select the **Get** function, and then choose **Locals**.  
  
13. In the **Get - C/AL Locals** window, choose the **Return Value** tab.  
  
14. In the **Name** field, enter **output**. In the **Return Type** field, select **Integer** from the drop-down list.  
  
15. Close the **Get -C/AL Locals** window.  
  
16. In the **C/AL Editor** for the codeunit, in the **Set** function section, enter the following code.  
  
    ```  
    InternalInt := input + 1;  
    Get;  
    ```  
  
     The code in the **Set** function increases the value of the input by one and sets this as the value of the internal variable. It then calls the **Get** function.  
  
17. In the **C/AL Editor**, in the **Get** function section, enter the following code.  
  
    ```  
    output := InternalInt;  
    ```  
  
     The code in the **Get** function specifies that the new value of the internal variable is the output value generated by this codeunit.  
  
18. Close the **C/AL Editor**. Choose **Yes** to save your changes to the codeunit.  
  
19. In the **Save As** window, in the **ID** field, enter **70000**.  
  
20. In the **Name** field, enter **Set\_Get**, select the **Compile** check box, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
## Creating the Second Codeunit  
 The next step is to create the codeunit that calls two instances of the Set\_Get codeunit and supplies the input values that these instances should use. This codeunit contains two variables, which are assigned to each other so that they both use the same instance of codeunit 70000.  
  
#### To create the second codeunit  
  
1.  In Object Designer, choose **Codeunit**, and then choose **New**.  
  
2.  On the **View** menu, choose **C/AL Globals**.  
  
3.  On the **Variables** tab, in the **Name** field, enter **CUInstance1** to create a new variable.  
  
4.  In the **DataType** field, select **Codeunit** from the drop-down list. In the **Subtype** field, select codeunit 70000, **Set\_Get**.  
  
5.  In the **C/AL GLobals** window, on the **Variables** tab, in the **Name** field, enter **CUInstance2** to create a second variable. In the **DataType** field, select **Codeunit** from the drop-down list. In the **Subtype** field, select codeunit 70000, **Set\_Get**.  
  
6.  Close the **C/AL GLobals** window.  
  
7.  In the **C/AL Editor**, add the following code to the OnRun trigger.  
  
    ```  
    CUInstance1.Set(1);  
    CUInstance2.Set(2);  
    MESSAGE('When running two instances, the value of CUInstance1 is %1 and the value of CUInstance2 is %2.', CUInstance1.Get, CUInstance2.Get);  
  
    CUInstance2 := CUInstance1;  
    MESSAGE('After assigning CUInstance2 to CUInstance1, the value of CUInstance1 is %1 and the value of CUInstance2 is also %2.', CUInstance1.Get, CUInstance2.Get);  
    ```  
  
     The first two statements in this codeunit call two instances of the Set\_Get codeunit and supply the input values that these instances should use. Next, the code prints a message with the return values of the two instances of the codeunit.  
  
     CUInstance1 returns 2.  
  
     CUInstance2 returns 3.  
  
     The next statement assigns the two variables to each other so that they both use the same instance of codeunit 70000 and therefore generate the same return value.  
  
8.  Close the **C/AL Editor** and choose **Yes** to save your changes to the codeunit.  
  
9. In the **Save As** window, in the **ID** field, enter **70001**. In the **Name** field, enter **Assignment**.  
  
10. Select the **Compile** check box, and then choose **OK**.  
  
## Testing the Codeunit  
 You will now test the codeunit that calls two instances of the Set\_Get codeunit.  
  
### To test the codeunit  
  
1.  In Object Designer, select codeunit 70001, and then choose **Run**. The following message is displayed: “When running two instances, the value of CUInstance1 is 2 and the value of CUInstance2 is 3.”  
  
2.  On the message box choose **OK**. A second message box is displayed with the following message: "After assigning CUInstance2 to CUInstance1, the value of CUInstance1 is 2 and the value of CUInstance2 is also 2."  
  
## Using a Single Instance Codeunit  
 In some cases, only one instance of a codeunit needs to exist. This means that all the codeunit variables of a particular codeunit use the same set of variables. You can make a codeunit a single instance codeunit by setting the **SingleInstance** property to **Yes**.  
  
### To modify a codeunit to a single instance codeunit  
  
1.  In Object Designer, choose **Codeunit**, select codeunit 70000, and then choose **Design**.  
  
2.  On the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Set\_Get - Properties** window, in the **SingleInstance** field, select **Yes** from the drop-down list.  
  
4.  Close the **Set\_Get - Properties** window.  
  
5.  On the **File** menu, choose **Save As**.  
  
6.  In the **Save As** window, in the **ID** field, enter **70002**.  
  
7.  In the **Name** field, enter **SingleInst** and select the **Compile** check box, and then choose **OK**.  
  
8.  In Object Designer, choose **Codeunit**, select codeunit 70000, and then choose **Design**.  
  
9. On the **View** menu, select **C/AL Globals**.  
  
10. On the **Variables** tab, in the **CUInstance1** row, in the **Subtype** field, select codeunit 70002, **SingleInst** from the code list and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
11. On the **Variables** tab, in the **CUInstance2** row, in the **Subtype** field, select codeunit 70002, **SingleInst** from the code list. Choose the **OK** button.  
  
12. Close the **C/AL Globals** window.  
  
13. In the **C/AL Editor**, replace the code in the OnRun trigger with the following code:  
  
    ```  
    CUInstance1.Set(7);  
    // A codeunit instance is created if one did not exist.  
    CUInstance2.Get();  
    // Returns 8, that is 7 + the 1 added by the Set function in   
    // codeunit 70002. CUInstance2 uses the same instance as CUInstance1,   
    // they use the same internal variables.  
    MESSAGE('The value of CUInstance2 is %1.', CUInstance2.Get);  
  
    ```  
  
     CUInstance2.Get returns 8, which is the input value 7 + the 1 added by the Set function in codeunit 70002. CUInstance2 uses the same instance as CUInstance1, therefore, they use the same internal variables.  
  
14. Close the **C/AL Editor**.  
  
15. In the **Save Changes** window, select the **Compiled** check box, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
  
## Testing the Single Instance Codeunit  
 The single instance codeunit variables use the same set of variables.  
  
### To test the single instance code unit  
  
1.  In Object Designer, select codeunit 70001, and choose **Run**. The following message is displayed, "The value of CUInstance2 is 8."  
  
     The CUInstance2 instance of codeunit 70002 is able to access the value of the InternalInt variable that was set by the CUInstance1 instance of codeunit 70002. This is because codeunit 70002 is specified as a single instance codeunit.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  It is possible to use a single instance codeunit across objects, not just within the same object.  
  
2.  In Object Designer, select codeunit 70002, and then choose the **Design** button.  
  
3.  On the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
4.  In the **SingleInst - Properties** window, in the **SingleInstance** field, select **No** from the drop-down list.  
  
5.  Close the **C/AL Editor**.  
  
6.  In the **Save Changes** window, select the **Compiled** check box, and choose **Yes**.  
  
7.  In Object Designer, select codeunit 70001, and then choose **Run**. The following message is displayed, "The value of CUInstance2 is 0."  
  
     Since codeunit 70002 is no longer a single instance codeunit, the CUInstance2 instance of codeunit 70002 is not able to access the value of the InternalInt variable that was set by the CUInstance1 instance of codeunit 70002.
