# How to: Manage Breakpoints from the Debugger Code Viewer
You can view, set, enable, disable, or delete breakpoints directly in the **Code** part of the **Debugger** window.  
  
 For more information about how to open the **Debugger** window, see [Activating the Debugger](Activating-the-Debugger.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you set a breakpoint from the debugger, then it is not displayed in the C/AL Editor. If you enable, disable, or delete a breakpoint from the debugger, that change is not displayed in the C/AL Editor until you open the editor again.  
  
### To view breakpoints in the code viewer  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, in the code viewer, breakpoints are displayed in the margin. An enabled breakpoint is identified by a red dot. A disabled breakpoint is identified by an unfilled red circle.  
  
### To set a breakpoint in the code viewer  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, in the code viewer, do one of the following:  
  
    -   Place the cursor on the line of code on which you want to set a breakpoint, and then on the **Home** tab, in the **Breakpoints** group, choose **Toggle**.  
  
         A red dot is displayed in the margin of the code, and the breakpoint is immediately enabled.  
  
    -   Choose the margin to the left of the line of code on which you want to set a breakpoint.  
  
         A red dot is displayed in the margin of the code, and the breakpoint is immediately enabled.  
  
### To enable a single breakpoint in the code viewer  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, in the code viewer, do one of the following:  
  
    -   Place the cursor on the line of code that has a disabled breakpoint, and then on the **Home** tab, in the **Breakpoints** group, choose **Toggle**.  
  
         The unfilled red circle changes to a red dot, and the breakpoint is immediately enabled.  
  
    -   Choose the unfilled red circle in the margin to the left of the line of code with the disabled breakpoint.  
  
         The unfilled red circle changes to a red dot, and the breakpoint is immediately enabled.  
  
### To disable all breakpoints in the code viewer  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Breakpoints** group, choose **Disable All**. All breakpoints, including breakpoints in other codeunits that are not currently displayed in the code viewer, are immediately disabled.  
  
### To delete a single breakpoint in the code viewer  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, in the code viewer, do one of the following:  
  
    -   Place the cursor on the line of code that has an enabled breakpoint, and then on the **Home** tab, in the **Breakpoints** group, choose **Toggle**.  
  
    -   Choose the red dot in the margin to the left of the line of code with the enabled breakpoint.
