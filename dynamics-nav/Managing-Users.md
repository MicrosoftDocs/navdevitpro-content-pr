# Managing Users in Dynamics NAV
Depending on your [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] solution, users and their access to the solution is managed in different ways. The users must have an account to access [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], but their experience inside the solution is controlled by user groups, permissions, and licenses.  

## [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Users and Credential Types  
 [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] supports four credential authorization mechanisms for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] users. When you create a user, you provide different information depending on the credential type you are using in the current [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance. For more information, see [Users and Credential Types](Users-and-Credential-Types.md).
