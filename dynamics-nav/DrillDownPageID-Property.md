# DrillDownPageID Property
Sets the ID of the page to use as a drill-down.  
  
## Applies To  
  
-   Page Fields  
  
-   Tables  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This property is not supported on Repeater controls on pages when it is displayed in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
## Remarks  
 Drill-downs are a system-wide feature of fields \(normal fields and [FlowFields](FlowFields.md)\) that let you see the underlying transactions that make up the information shown in the field. For example, the DrillDownID property is typically used to create a link from a Cue to an underlying page.
