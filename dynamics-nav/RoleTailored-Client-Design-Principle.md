# RoleTailored Client Design Principle
## Design Principle  
 The RoleTailored clients have a customizable user interface that supports the job functions of different work roles in your organization. The RoleTailored clients are built around a navigation structure based on a user\-centric design. The RoleTailored clients are comprised of a number of pages, similar to pages, which contain different information and tasks. The pages are combined in the RoleTailored clients and displayed in a series of windows  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The term RoleTailored client, which in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 referred only to the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows client, now can designate either the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows client or the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Web client.  
  
 In a RoleTailored client, a user starts from a single navigational window called the Role Center that displays information pertinent to his or her role in the company. From the Role Center, the user can navigate to additional information and open separate windows for performing tasks and viewing data. For each role that you support, you can create a Role Center that displays key information and tasks that are required by that role.
