# Page Designer Troubleshooting
This topic contains information about known troubleshooting issues in Page Designer.  
  
## OK and Cancel Button Unavailable in the Field Menu Window  
 The Field Menu window enables you to add fields and source expressions to a page. There are two ways in which you can use the Field Menu window:  
  
1.  You can select a row of Type Field, choose **View**, and then choose **Field Menu**. Choose the field or fields that you want to be a source expression for the field and choose **OK** or **Apply**. You will see a message box asking, “Do you want to add the fields that are selected in the field menu?”  
  
2.  You can open the **Field Menu** window, select the fields that you want to add, and then select the row in the page where you want to insert fields. If you choose this method, the **OK** and **Cancel** buttons are unavailable in the **Field Menu** window. If you click anywhere in the **Page Designer** window, you will see a message box asking, “Do you want to add the fields that are selected in the field menu?”
