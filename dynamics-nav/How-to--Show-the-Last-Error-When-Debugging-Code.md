# How to: Show the Last Error When Debugging Code
On the **Debugger** page, if code execution has paused and an error has occurred in the session that is being debugged, then you can show the last error message. This allows you to see the error that has occurred prior to the break.  
  
### To show the last error when debugging code  
  
-   In the **Debugger** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Show** group, choose **Last Error**. The last error message is displayed.
