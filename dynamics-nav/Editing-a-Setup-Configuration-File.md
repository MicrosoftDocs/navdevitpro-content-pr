# Editing a Setup Configuration File
You create or load Setup configuration files using [!INCLUDE[navnowlong](includes/navnowlong_md.md)] Setup. You can directly edit these XML files.  
  
 Setup configuration files contain two types of settings.  
  
|Setting type|Purpose|  
|------------------|-------------|  
|Component|For each component, there are three separate values, all displayed on a single line:<br /><br /> -   **ShowOptionNode**<br />     Specifies whether the component should be displayed in Setup. For silent installs, this parameter is not relevant.<br />-   **State**<br />     There are two possible values: **Local**, indicates that the component is included in the install, and **Absent** indicates that the component is not included.<br />-   **Id**<br />     Identifies the component<br /><br /> You can change value for **State** or **ShowOptionNode**, but not for **Id**. Also, you cannot add or remove a component.|  
|Parameter|These settings contain configuration information for components. As with Components, you can modify a parameterâ€™s **Value**, but not its **Id**.<br /><br /> For information about values for pre-configuring [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] components using a Setup configuration file, see [Configuring Microsoft Dynamics NAV](Configuring-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV.md).|  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup is primarily a tool for installing software, but you can also use it as an editor for creating and modifying Setup configuration files. When you want to edit a Setup configuration file, you have the following options:  
>   
>  -   You can edit the file using an XML editor.  
> -   You can load it into Setup, make the desired modifications, and then save it. You do not need to install any software during this process.
