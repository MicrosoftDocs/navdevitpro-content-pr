# Extending Microsoft Dynamics NAV Using Microsoft .NET Framework Interoperability
You can extend the [!INCLUDE[rtc](includes/rtc_md.md)]s and [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] with functionality that is available in Microsoft .NET Framework assemblies. You can take advantage of .NET Framework interoperability so that [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects can interact with .NET Framework objects. In your [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] objects, you can reference .NET Framework assemblies and call their members directly from C/AL code. You can use assemblies from the .NET Framework class library, which are found in the global assembly cache; your own custom assemblies; or third-party assemblies. For more information, see [Assembly Installation in the GAC](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=196848).  

 .NET Framework interoperability offers an alternative to COM so that you can extend your solution. For example, you can use .NET Framework interoperability to:  

-   Consume web services.  

-   Integrate with Microsoft Office products.  

-   Create .NET Framework applications that target the [!INCLUDE[rtc](includes/rtc_md.md)].  

## [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] support  
 For the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], you can only implement Microsoft .NET Framework Interoperability objects that are configured to run on [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)]. Client-side objects are not supported. For more information, see [Setting .NET Framework Types to Target the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Windows Client or Server](Setting-.NET-Framework-Types-to-Target-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Windows-Client-or-Server.md)
