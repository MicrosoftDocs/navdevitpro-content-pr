# Deploying Microsoft Dynamics NAV on One Virtual Machine Using Example-1VM Script
This topic describes the Example-1VM.ps1 script of the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_long](includes/nav_prov_long_md.md)]. The script is located in the \\WindowsPowerShellScripts\\Cloud\\HowTo folder on the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] installation media \(DVD\). The Example-1VM.ps1 script deploys [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on a single Microsoft Azure virtual machine. After the script is run, you will have a fully functional environment that enables you to access [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] data from the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].  
  
 For information about how to use the script, see [How to: Deploy Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Microsoft Azure by Using the Example Scripts](How-to--Deploy-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-Microsoft-Azure-by-Using-the-Example-Scripts.md) or [Walkthrough: Deploying Microsoft Dynamics NAV on a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine](Walkthrough--Deploying-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-a-Microsoft-Azure-Virtual-Machine.md) for a step-by-step example.  
  
## Deployment Overview  
 The Example-1VM.ps1 script creates a virtual machine on Azure, which is based on an image that you specify, and then installs and configures [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database components for SQL Server.

 The script restores a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] application database of your choice, along with a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] license. You can choose to install the [!INCLUDE[demolong](includes/demolong_md.md)] and license. The script also configures endpoints in Azure for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] client services and management services and opens the communication ports in Windows Firewall.  
  
 When the script is finished, you will have functional [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] environment that has the following characteristics:  
  
-   A website on Internet Information Services \(IIS\) with a web server instance for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. The website runs on TCP port 443 and uses https protocol. Users can access [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] data by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] from a web browser.  
  
-   A [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance that connects to the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database.  
  
-   OData and SOAP Web services are enabled and configured to use https protocol.  
  
-   A [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] application database that is configured to have a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] license file, company, and a single [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user that has SUPER permissions.  
  
-   Uses NavUserPassword credential type as the user authentication method.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] available by using ClickOnce website.  
  
## Deployment Process  
 The Example-1VM.ps1 is a combination of several of the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_short](includes/nav_prov_short_md.md)] scripts that are called at various points in the deployment process. Before running each script, a secure Windows PowerShell remote session using HTTPS is established between the provisioning computer and the Azure virtual machine.

### Deployment Phases  
 The following flow chart illustrates the process that is executed by the Example-1VM.ps1 script to deploy [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. The dashed boxes illustrate the manual alternatives in the flow.

 The following table provides a description of each phase in the process and the Windows PowerShell script that is executed.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The scripts are located in the *Cloud\\NAVRemoteAdministrationSamples* folder of the [!INCLUDE[nav_prov_long](includes/nav_prov_long_md.md)].

|Phase|Script|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Import cmdlets and scripts**|Set-PowerShellEnvironment.ps1|Imports NavAzureRemoteAdminToolsSamples.psm1 with all the HowTo-prefixed scripts. Other PowerShell modules are automatically imported as needed.|  
|**Import the publishsettings file**|Set-PowerShellEnvironment.ps1|Imports the PublishSettingsFile that was downloaded when Azure PowerShell was installed.<br /><br /> Selects the Azure storage account and imports the Azure subscription ID and certificates.<br /><br /> For more information about these items, see [Preparing for Deploying Microsoft Dynamics NAV on Microsoft Azure](Preparing-for-Deploying-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-on-Microsoft-Azure.md).|  
|**Create new VM**|HowTo-CreateAzureVM|PowerShell session established.<br /><br /> Creates a new virtual machine based on a selected image from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.<br /><br /> NavAdministration module is transferred to new virtual machine.|  
|**Upload files to VM**|HowTo-UploadFilesToVM|Creates a .VHD file and uploads the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] installation files to Azure storage.<br /><br /> Alternatively, the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] installation files can be copied directly from the provisioning computer to the virtual machine through an active PowerShell session. To specify whether to use a VHD, change the $NAV\_UseAzureStorageForDvdTransfer variable in the script.|  
|**Install NAV on VM**|HowTo-InstallNAVonVM|NAVAdministration module cmdlets are executed through a PowerShell session.<br /><br /> Installs [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] on the virtual machine. The [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance and [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] instance are not installed in this phase.|  
|**Add server instance**|HowTo-AddNAVInstance|Establishes a PowerShell session, and then does the following:<br /><br /> -   Installs a [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance.<br />-   Installs a [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] web server instance on IIS for [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].<br />-   Creates a ClickOnce website for [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] deployment.<br />-   Restores the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] database from the .bak file.<br />-   Adds [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] user.<br />-   Imports the [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)] license.<br />-   Adds Azure endpoints.<br />-   Configures Windows Firewall.|
