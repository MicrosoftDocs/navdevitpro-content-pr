# DataClassification Property
Sets the classification of the data in the table or field. The data classification can be used to adhere to security, compliance, and privacy requirements and processes for collecting, storing, and using user personal information.  

## Applies to  

-   Table objects
-   Table field controls that are not specified as FlowFields or FlowFilters.

## Property Values

|---------------|---------------------|
|ToBeClassified|Content that has not yet been given a classification. This is the initial value when table or field is created.|
|CustomerContent|Content directly provided/created by admins and users. This is the default when no value has been specified.|
|EndUserIdentificationInformation|(EUII) Data that identifies or could be used to identify the user of a Microsoft service. EUII does not contain Customer content. | 
|AccountData|Customer billing information and payment instrument information, including administrator contact information, such as tenant administrator’s name, address, or phone number.|
