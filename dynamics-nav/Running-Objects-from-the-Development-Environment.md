# Running Objects from the Development Environment
In Object Designer in the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], you can run any object. The object is run on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)], not on a client computer.  
  
 To run an object from Object Designer, you must first open a company. If you do not have a company open, then you are prompted to open a company or to create a company if no companies exist.  
  
 You can also run objects from hyperlinks. For more information, see [Creating and Running Hyperlinks](Creating-and-Running-Hyperlinks.md).  
  
 The instance of [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] on which the object is run is specified in the **Database Information** window and in the **Options** window. For more information about how to change the server instance, see [How to: Change the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Server Instance](How-to--Change-the-Microsoft-Dynamics-NAV-Server-Instance.md).  
  
 If there is only one [!INCLUDE[nav_server](includes/nav_server_md.md)] instance configured for the currently open database, then this instance is automatically used to run the object.
