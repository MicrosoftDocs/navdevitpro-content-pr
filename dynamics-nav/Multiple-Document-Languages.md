# Multiple Document Languages
With a multlanguage-enabled database you can automatically  get the languages needed for multiple document language functionality.  
  
## Running Multiple Document Languages  
 If you have documents that you want to print in the language of the recipient rather than in your own working language, you can add a single line of code in the document to handle this. This functionality is already enabled for most reports in the standard [!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] database. The document is printed in the language that is specified in the **Language Code** field in the **Customer Card** window.  
  
 In reports that need the multiple document languages functionality, you must insert the following C/AL code as the first line in the **OnAfterGet Record\(\)** trigger:  
  
 `CurrReport.LANGUAGE := Language.GetLanguageID("Language Code")`  
  
 For each of these reports, you must create a new variable, `Language`, with the data type `Record` pointing to the **Language** table \(table 8\). When you have compiled the object, it will no longer print in the userâ€™s working application language if another language has been specified in the **Customer Card** window.
