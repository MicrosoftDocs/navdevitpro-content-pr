# Rule Set for the Code Analysis Tool 

In an AL project, you can use a custom rule set file to specify how code analysis will report the issues it encounters. Different settings can affect how rules are applied and each rule set file name must follow the pattern `<name>.ruleset.json` to benefit from Intellisense in Visual Studio Code.  

The following table describes the settings in a `<name>.ruleset.json` file:

|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
|name|Yes|String|The name of the rule set.|
|description|No|String|The description of the rule set. You can use this to document the purpose of the rule set.|
|generalAction|No|`Error`&#124;`Warning`&#124;`Info`&#124;`Hidden`|The action to apply to all the diagnostics that have rules defined in this file or in other files that have a `Default` action specified and to all the diagnostics generated by the current set of analyzers that do not have a rule defined. If an included file has a stricter `generalAction`, that one will be used.|
|includedRuleSets|No|Array of `IncludedRuleSet`|List of external rule set files to include in the current rule set. The order in which the files are processed is undefined. |
|analyzerRules|No|Array of `AnalyzerRule`|Collection of rules to apply to diagnostics generated by individual analyzers.|

An `IncludedRuleSet` is a complex JSON object that defines the inclusion of an external rule set file in the current rule set, and it has the following properties:   
|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
|path|Yes|String|The path to the included file. For includes specified in the file to which the `al.ruleSetPath` is set, the path can be absolute or relative to the project folder. For files included from the root rule set file, the path is relative to the file.|
|action|Yes|`Error`&#124;`Warning`&#124;`Info`&#124;`Hidden`&#124;`None`&#124;`Default`|The action to apply for all the diagnostics that have an action specified in the included rule set that is different from `None` and `Hidden`.|

An `AnalyzerRule` is a complex JSON object that contains the rules specific to an analyzer with the following properties:    
|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
|analyzerId|Yes|String|The string that uniquely identifies the analyzer to which the rules apply. This value is used only for documentation purposes.|
|rules|Yes|Array of `Rule`|The collection of rules to be applied to diagnostics generated by this analyzer.|

A `Rule` is a complex JSON object that specifies how you can process a specific diagnostic. A `Rule` object has the following properties:     
|Setting|Mandatory|Type|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
|id|Yes|String|The string that uniquely identifies a diagnostic.|
|action|Yes|`Error`&#124;`Warning`&#124;`Info`&#124;`Hidden`&#124;`None`|The action to apply if the diagnostic is emitted. There cannot be two rules with the same id and different actions in the same rule file. |
