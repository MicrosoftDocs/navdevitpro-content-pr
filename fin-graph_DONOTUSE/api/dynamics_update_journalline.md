# Update journalLines
Update the properties of a journal lines object for Dynamics 365 for Financials.

## HTTP request

```
PATCH /financials/companies/({id})/journals/{ID}/journalLines/({id})
```

## Request headers
|Header|Value|
|------|-----|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type  |application/json|
|If-Match      |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the journalLines, the journalLines will not be updated. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.
