# IMPORTFILE Method (Media)
Adds a media type, such as a JPEG image, from a file to a **Media** data type field of a record for displaying the media with the record in the client. The media file is imported to the application database, and a reference to the media is included in the **Media** data type field.

## Syntax

```

[Guid := ]Record.MediaField.IMPORTFILE(FileName, Description[, MimeType])
```

#### Parameters
 *Record*  
 Type: Record

Specifies the record that you want to add the media to.

 *MediaField*  
Type: Media

 Specifies the field that you want to add the media to. This field must be a **Media** data type.

 *FileName*  
 Type: Text

 Specifies the full path and name of the media file to be added.

 *Description*  
 Type: Text

 Specifies text that can be used in the client to describe the media.

 *MimeType*  
 Type: Text

[!INCLUDE[mimetype](../includes/mimetype_md.md)]

## Property Value/Return Value
 Type: GUID

 Specifies the unique ID that is assigned to the media object in the database. You can also get the ID by using the [MEDIAID Method \(Media\)](devenv-MEDIAID-Method-Media.md).

## Remarks
 You use this method to upload a media, which you want to associate with a record, to the database. For example, you can upload an JPEG image for a record in a table. When a media file is imported, it is assigned a unique identifier \(GUID\) and stored in the system table **2000000183 Tenant Media** of the application database. The GUID is then included in the **Media** data type field as a reference to the media file.

If you import a media file into a record that already has a media object, and a modify operation is performed, the original media object will be permanently deleted from the database. However, if there are other rows in the same table that reference the original media object from the same field index, the original media object is not deleted from the database. This behavior allows a row to be copied.

## Example
This example uses the IMPORTFILE method to import a JPEG image from file to a record in a database table. After the image is imported, it can be displayed on a list page that uses the table, when the page is opened<!--NAV in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_web_md](../includes/d365fin_web_md.md)]--> and viewed in a brick layout.

**Preparation:**

To support the example code that follows, create the following objects:

-   A table that is named **My Items** and has the following characteristics (as a minimum):
    -   An **Integer** data type field that has the name **No.**.

        This field is used to give an item a number.
    -   A **Media** data type field that has the name **Image**.

        This is the field on which you will import the media file.
    - A field group that has the name **Brick** and includes the **No.** and **Image** fields.

        The field group is used to display the image on a page in the brick layout. <!--LinksFor more information, see [How to: Display Data as Bricks](How-to--Display-Data-as-Bricks.md).-->
-   A page that is named **My Items** and has the following characteristics:

    -   List type page that uses the **My Items** table as its source.
    -   A repeater control that contains the fields of the **My Items** table.

        >[!NOTE]
        >It is not necessary to include the **Media** data type field on the page.

    Use the page to add one or more items to the table, assigning each item a number like 1,2,3, and so on.

-   JPEG image files for one or more items in the **My Items** table.
    -   Give each file a name that corresponds to an item number in the table, such as 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, and so on.
    -   Save the files in the *C:\images* folder on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server_md](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)].

**Code:**

With the objects in place, you can add and run the following AL code to import the images. For this code example, create a codeunit and add the code to the **OnRun** trigger of the codeunit.

The example code iterates over records in the **My Items** table. For each record, it looks in the *C:\images* folder for a file whose name matches the **No.** field of the record. If there is a match, the file is imported and a message appears; otherwise, nothing happens.

The code requires that you create the following variable and text constant:

|  Variable name  |  DataType  |  Subtype  |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
|  myItemRec  |  Record  |  My Items  |
|  fileName  |  Text  |  |
|  imageID  |  GUID  |  |

|Text constant name|ConstValue|
|-------------------|--------------|
|Text000|An image with the following ID has been imported on item %1: %2|

```
IF myItemRec.FINDFIRST() THEN
BEGIN  
  REPEAT
    fileName := 'C:\images\' + FORMAT(myItemRec."No.") + '.jpg';
    IF FILE.EXISTS(fileName) THEN BEGIN
      imageID := myItemRec.Image.IMPORTFILE(fileName, 'Demo image for item ' + FORMAT(myItemRec."No."));
      myItemRec.MODIFY;
      MESSAGE(Text000, myItemRec."No.", imageID)
    END;
  UNTIL myItemRec.NEXT < 1;
END;
```
