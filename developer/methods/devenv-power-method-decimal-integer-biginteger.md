# POWER Method (Decimal, Integer, BigInteger)
Raises a number to a power. For example, you can use this method to square the number 2 to get the result of 4.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
NewNumber := POWER(Number, Power)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Number*  
 Type: Integer or Decimal  
  
 The number you want to raise exponentially. This number is the base in the exponential method.  
  
 *Power*  
 Type: Integer or Decimal  
  
 The exponent in the exponential method.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 Type: Decimal  
  
 The result of raising *Number* by *Power*.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create the following global variables and text constants.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|Number1|Decimal|  
|Power1|Decimal|  
|Result1|Decimal|  
  
|Text constant name|Constant value|  
|------------------------|--------------------|  
|Text000|%1 raised to the power of %2 = %3|  
  
```  
Number1 := 64;   
Power1 := 0.5;  
Result1 := POWER(Number1, Power1);  
MESSAGE(Text000, Number1, Power1, Result1)  
```  
  
 On a computer that has the regional format set to English \(United States\), the first message window displays the following:  
  
 **64 raised to the power of 0.5 = 8**  
  
 This example shows that raising a number to the power of 0.5 corresponds to the square root of the number.  
  
## Example  
 This example shows a typical use for the POWER method.  
  
 If a principal amount P is deposited at interest rate R and compounded annually, then at the end of N years, the accumulated amount \(A\) is:  
  
 A = P\(1 + R\)<sup>N</sup>  
  
 For example, you put LCY 2800 into a bank account that pays 5 percent, which is compounded quarterly. To determine what the amount will be in eight years, you must consider:  
  
 N = 32 payment periods \(8 years times 4 quarterly periods\)  
  
 R = 0.0125 per period \(5 percent divided by 4 quarterly periods\)  
  
 The accumulated amount A is:  
  
 A = LCY 2800\(1 + 0.0125\)<sup>32</sup> =LCY 2800\(1.4881\) = LCY 4166.77  
  
 If a principal amount P is deposited at the end of each year at interest rate R \(in decimal notation\) compounded annually, then at the end of N years, the accumulated amount is:  
  
 A = P\[\(\(1 + R\)<sup>N</sup> - 1\)/R\]  
  
 This is typically called an *annuity*.  
  
 For example, you have an annuity in which a payment of LCY 500 is made at the end of each year. The interest on this annuity is 4 percent, which is compounded annually. To determine what the annuity will be worth in 20 years, you must consider:  
  
 R = 0.04  
  
 N = 20  
  
 The amount of the annuity A will be:  
  
 A = LCY 500\[\(\(1 + 0.04\)<sup>20</sup> - 1\)/0.04 = LCY 14,889.04  
  
 This example requires that you create the following global variables and text constants.  
  
|Variable name|DataType|  
|-------------------|--------------|  
|P|Decimal|  
|R|Decimal|  
|N|Decimal|  
|A|Decimal|  
|FormatString|Text|  
  
|Text constant name|Constant value|  
|------------------------|--------------------|  
|Text000|Principal $%1 at a 5 percent interest rate is compounded quarterly.\\|  
|Text001|\(Rate = %2\)\\|  
|Text002|The amount after %3 years = $%4.|  
|Text003|Principal $%1 is deposited at the end of each year at a 4 percent interest rate, compounded annually.\\|  
|Text004|\(Rate = %2\)\\|  
|Text005|The amount after %3 years = $%4.|  
  
```  
FormatString := '<Precision,2><Standard Format,1>';  
// Example 1  
P := 2800;  
R := 0.0125;  
N := 32;  
A = P * (POWER(1 + R, N));  
MESSAGE(Text000 + Text001 + Text002, P, R, N, FORMAT(A,0,FormatString);  
// Example 2  
P = 500;  
R = 0.04;  
N = 20;  
A = P * ((POWER(1 + R, N) - 1)/R);  
MESSAGE(Text001, P, R, N, FORMAT(A,0,FormatString));  
```  
  
 On a computer that has the regional format set to English \(United States\), the first message window displays the following:  
  
 **Principal $2,800 at a 5 percent interest rate is compounded quarterly.**  
  
 **\(Rate = 0.0125\)**  
  
 **The amount after 32 years = $4166.77.**  
  
 The second message window displays the following:  
  
 **Principal $500 is deposited at the end of each year at a 4 percent interest rate, compounded annually.**  
  
 **\(Rate = 0.04\)**  
  
 **The amount after 20 years = $14889.04.**
