# Field No. Property
Sets a unique numeric ID for the field.  
  
## Applies To  
 Fields  
  
## Remarks  
 No two fields can have the same Field No. within a table. The Field No. is used for reference purposes and you can use the [Name Property](Name-Property.md) in code. The Name is automatically converted to the Field No. when AL code is compiled.  
  
 Usually, the Field No. is automatically assigned by Table Designer when you add fields to a table.
