# EventPublisherObject Property
Specifies the object that contains the event publisher function that the event subscriber responds to.  
  
## Applies to  
  
-   AL functions.  
  
     This property is only available when the [Event Property](Event-Property.md) is set to **Subscriber**.  
  
## Property Value  
 Application object.  
  
## Remarks  
 You use this property to set up an event subscriber function to subscribe to a published event. There are three types of events: business, integration, and trigger.  
  
-   Business and integration events are published by event publisher functions in objects such as codeunits, pages, or tables. To subscribe to a business or integration type event, you specify the object that contains the event publisher function for the event.  
  
-   Trigger events are system events that are declared in tables. To subscribe to a trigger event, you specify the table.  
  
 After you set this property, you set the [EventFunction Property](EventFunction-Property.md) to specify the event publisher function that you want the event subscriber to subscribe to.  
  
 For more information about events, see [Event Types](Event-Types.md) and [Subscribing to Events](Subscribing-to-Events.md).
