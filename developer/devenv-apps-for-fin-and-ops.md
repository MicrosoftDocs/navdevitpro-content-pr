|----------------|---------------|
|A **Connect App** establishes a connection between two independent services using an API to interchange data. A typical example of a Connect App is a Payroll solution. All work related to Payroll is done inside the payroll system, and only as a last step is the financial data posted into Dynamics 365 for Financials using the API. A Connect App is mainly created using common development tools, REST API’s, and the API’s made available in Dynamics 365 for Financials from Update 7 and onwards. A Connect App can have a single page or two created as an extension used for setup, configuration or to support for example an import scenario.|An extension can either be an **Add-On** or an **Embed** solution. An Add-On adds to the existing Dynamics 365 for Financials functionality to integrate a solution such as online payment, whereas an Embed solution implements an end-to-end experience such as a solution for the dental industry or law firms. An extension typically makes use of the variety of development tools for Dynamics 365 for Financials and can also include the APIs available for Dynamics 365 for Financials. An embedded solution can furthermore be rebranded to become an integrated part of the overall end-to-end experience.
