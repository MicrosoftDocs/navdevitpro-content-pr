# AccessByPermission Property
Sets a value for a table field or UI element that determines the permission mask for an object that a user must have to see and access the related page fields or UI element in the client. The UI element will be removed at runtime if the user does not have permissions to a certain object as specified in the **Access By Permission** window.

 All types of UI elements will be removed if they relate to an object to which the user does not have the required permissions:  

-   Fields on pages, including FactBoxes  

-   Actions on pages, including toolbars and navigation panes  

-   Page parts, such as **Lines** FastTabs  

<!--
> [!NOTE]  
>  To use this property, the **UI Elements Removal** field in the [!INCLUDE[nav_admin](includes/nav_admin_md.md)] must be set to **LicenseFile** or **LicenseFileAndUserPermissions**. For more information, see [How to: Specify When UI Elements Are Removed](How-to--Specify-When-UI-Elements-Are-Removed.md).
