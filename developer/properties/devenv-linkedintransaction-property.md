# LinkedInTransaction Property
Gets and sets data from linked server data sources, such as Microsoft Office Excel, Access, or another SQL Server.  
  
## Applies To  
 Tables  
  
## Remarks  
 This property is available when the [LinkedObject Property](devenv-linkedobject-property.md) is set to **true**.  
  
 Set the **LinkedInTransaction** property to **false** when the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] table description refers to an object outside the current database or on a linked server.  
  
 The access to linked server data sources is not under [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] transaction control. This means that if a [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] transaction is aborted, then any changes that were made to a linked object that is outside the current database or on a linked server during this transaction will remain in effect.
