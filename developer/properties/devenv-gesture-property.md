# Gesture Property
Specifies a gesture that runs the action on a device with a touch interface, such as the phone client.

## Applies to
*  Page Action controls

## Property values
The property has the following values:

|  Value  |  Description  |
|---------|---------------|
|**None** |No gesture for the action.|
|**LeftSwipe**|Swipe in from the right edge of the touch interface.  |
|**RightSwipe**|Swipe in from the left edge of the touch interface.  |

## Remarks
You typically use the Gesture property on list type pages for executing an action on items in a repeater control.

In Action Designer, you can use the **Gesture** column to view the Gesture property value for all page actions. If the **Gesture** column is not visible, then on the **View** menu, choose **Show Column**, and then select **Gesture**.
