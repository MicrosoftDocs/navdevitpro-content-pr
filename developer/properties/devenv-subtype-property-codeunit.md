# SubType Property (Codeunit)
Sets the codeunit to method as a normal, test, test runner, or upgrade codeunit.  
  
## Applies To  
 Codeunits  
  
## Property Value  
  
|**Value**|**Description**|  
|---------------|---------------------|  
|**Normal**|A normal codeunit. This is the default setting.|  
|**Test**|A test codeunit includes AL methods that test the application. <!-- For more information, see [How to: Create Test Codeunits and Test Methods](../devenv-how-to-create-test-codeunits-and-test-methods.md).-->|  
|**TestRunner**|A test runner codeunit manages the execution of one or more test codeunits. <!-- For more information, see [How to: Create a Test Runner Codeunit](../devenv-how-to-create-a-test-runner-codeunit.md).-->|  
|**Upgrade**|An upgrade codeunit includes AL methods for synchronizing changes to a table definition in an application with the business data table in SQL Server and migrating existing data. <!-- For more information, see [Upgrade Codeunits](../devenv-upgrade-codeunits.md).-->|  
  
## Remarks  
You can create test codeunits and test runner codeunits to test your application.  
  
You write test methods as AL code in the test codeunits. When a test codeunit runs, it executes the OnRun method and then executes each test method in the codeunit, records the outcome in a log, and displays the results in a message window. The continuation of the test method run is dependent on successful run of the OnRun method. The difference between a normal codeunit and a test codeunit is their execution at run time. When a normal codeunit is run, if one of its methods fails, then the codeunit is terminated. When a test codeunit is run, if a method fails, then the method is terminated, but the codeunit continues to run the remaining methods.  
  
A test runner codeunit runs the test codeunits that are programmed to run from its OnRun trigger. When a test runner codeunit runs, it does the following:  
  
-   Calls the [OnBeforeTestRun Trigger](../triggers/devenv-onbeforetestrun-trigger.md) before each test codeunit, and the OnRun method and test method is executed.  
  
-   Calls the [OnAfterTestRun Trigger](../triggers/devenv-onaftertestrun-trigger.md) after each test code unit, and the OnRun method and test method is executed.  
  
-   Indicates that a test method has failed if it invokes the user interface.
