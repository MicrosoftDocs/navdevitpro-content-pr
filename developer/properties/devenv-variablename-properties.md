# VariableName Properties
Sets a variable name for the table that you have specified in the [SourceTable Property](SourceTable-Property.md). It is also used to specify a variable name for a text that you have specified in the [SourceType Property](SourceType-Property.md).  
  
## Applies To  
 XMLports  
  
## Remarks  
 The text or table variables that you define here act the same way as variables that are defined in the AL Globals window. However, these variables are only visible in the AL Symbol Menu.  
  
 The values of the VariableName and [SourceTable Property](SourceTable-Property.md) correspond to the contents of the DataSource field in XMLport Designer. The values that you enter in these properties in the **Properties** window are shown in the DataSource field in XMLport Designer.  
  
 If you have defined a text variable, you can only see the name of the text variable in the DataSource field in XMLport Designer.  
  
 If you have defined a table as an XML item, the DataSource field can display the following information.  
  
 **Properties window:**  
  
 SourceTable  
  
 *Customer*  
  
 *Customer*  
  
 VariableName  
  
 `<Customer>` default  
  
 Cust.  
  
 **XMLport Designer:**  
  
 DataSource field  
  
 `<Customer>` \(Customer\)  
  
 Cust. `<Customer>`
